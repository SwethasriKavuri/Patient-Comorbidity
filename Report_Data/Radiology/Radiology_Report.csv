Technique
Multiple sequences were performed through the brain in multiple 
planes.  
 
Comparison
Brain MRI dated 04/26/2011.  
 
Findings
Again noted, status post right temporal lobectomy. There is mild 
residual FLAIR hyperintensity within the surgical bed, without 
associated diffusion restriction on ADC mapping. There are a few 
scattered punctate white matter FLAIR hyperintensities bilaterally 
without associated diffusion restriction and that appear stable in 
distribution from prior examination (for example see image 66 of 
series 101 and the left all right parietal subcortical white matter 
close). There is no evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest acute 
infarction.  
 
Ventricles, cisterns and sulci are age appropriate in size.  
 
There is no mass, mass effect, or midline shift.  
 
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection.  
 
There is normal flow voids in the major arteries of the circle of 
Willis.  
 
The pituitary gland is normal in size.  
 
There is no significant disease in the paranasal sinuses. No gross 
abnormality is noted within the orbits.

MRI of the brain with and without contrast.  
 
 
Clinical History
History of primary progressive multiple sclerosis.  
 
Technique
Multisequential, multiplanar MRI of the brain was performed without 
intravenous contrast.  
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent GADAVIST 6 milliliters 01/16/2015 INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
Comparison
Prior MRI brain dated 07/31/2007  
 
Findings
This examination is somewhat limited by motion on multiple sequences.  

 
There are innumerable foci of T2/FLAIR signal scattered within the 
periventricular, deep and juxtacortical white matter, brainstem, left 
cerebellar peduncle and cerebellum. Allowing for differences in 
technique, these are overall grossly unchanged in extent when 
compared with the prior study. Some of these lesions in the 
periventricular white matter are oriented perpendicular to the long 
axis of the lateral ventricles, which are characteristic for 
demyelinating lesions of MS. many of the lesions are T1 hypointense. 
These lesions are not associated with enhancement or restricted 
diffusion, which would suggest active demyelination.  
 
There is no restricted diffusion of parenchyma to suggest acute 
infarction.  There are no enhancing mass lesions in the parenchyma. 
No evidence of abnormal intracranial enhancement. There is a right 
frontal developmental venous anomaly, a variant of normal venous 
drainage. There is no mass effect or midline shift. There are 
generalized age-related involutional changes with secondary 
prominence of cortical sulci and ventricles with no evidence of 
hydrocephalus.  
 
There is no tonsillar herniation.  The basal cisterns are intact. The 
sella turcica is unremarkable. The flow voids of the central arteries 
and the circle of Willis and major dural sinuses are present. The 
left vertebral artery is tortuous and indents on the underlying left 
paramedian medulla. 
 
There are no fluid levels in the visualized paranasal sinuses and 
mastoid air cells. The visualized intraorbital contents are 
unremarkable.   
 
Impression
Innumerable hyperintense T2/FLAIR lesions, as described above, 
compatible with demyelinating lesions in this patient with a known 
history of multiple sclerosis. These are overall unchanged in extent 
when compared with the study of 07/31/2007 MRI. No restricted 
diffusion or enhancement within these lesions to suggest active 
demyelination.  
 
No evidence of acute infarct.  No enhancing mass lesion in the 
parenchyma. No mass effect, midline shift or hydrocephalus.

Findings
There are multiple (greater than 9) foci of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity 
in the juxtacortical (at least 1), subcortical, periventricular 
(greater than 3), and deep white matter. The periventricular lesions 
demonstrate perpendicular orientation in relation to the ventricles.  
There are similarly appearing lesions in the left midbrain, right 
brachium pontis/ funds junction, and left cerebellum. This is 
consistent with known history of demyelination. There are new lesions 
in the right temporal lobe, 2 lesions in the right periatrial white 
matter which demonstrate enhancement and consistent with acute 
demyelination, right parietal periventricular white matter, and right 
dorsal pons which also demonstrates enhancement. 
 
The ventricles, sulci, and fissures are normal in size and 
configuration.  There is no abnormal restricted diffusion to suggest 
acute or subacute evolving infarct, intracranial hemorrhage, mass. 
There is no evidence for midline shift or transtentorial herniation. 
The major intracranial vascular structures demonstrate T2 flow voids. 
The orbits and visualized soft tissues are normal. The visualized 
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.

Correlation is made with the Outside MRI brain dated 11/03/2014 and 
noncontrast MRI brain dated 06/12/2011. 
 
Findings
Status post right total frontal craniectomy and cranioplasty. There 
is bilateral parietal approach ventriculostomy catheters, with the 
tips of these catheters terminating all in the frontal horn of left 
lateral ventricle and adjacent to the right foramen of Monro. There 
is an area of encephalomalacia and gliosis in the right frontal lobe, 
below the cranioplasty.  There are some prominent hyperdense 
extra-axial soft tissue along the surgical margins, likely reflecting 
postsurgical change.  
 
There are extensive areas nodular hyperdense soft tissue, 
infiltrating the pre chiasmatic optic nerves, optic chiasm, 
hypothalamic region, extending posteriorly along the expected region 
of the left optic tract and anteriorly into the intraorbital left 
optic nerve. There is nodular soft tissue in the medial left temporal 
lobe with surrounding low attenuation, representing edema. This 
hyperdense soft tissue appears to extend superiorly into the left 
basal ganglia and inferiorly into the left cerebral peduncle. 
Additionally there is adjacent to the atrium of the right lateral 
ventricle which appears to extend into the right basal ganglia. There 
is also hyperdense soft tissue and extending along the intracanicular 
right optic nerve. Additional hyperdense nodular soft tissue in the 
region of the right pulvinar, compresses the underlying right lateral 
ventricle, with resultant resultant moderate enlargement of the right 
temporal horn, which is trapped. Low attenuation surrounding this 
large right temporal horn may represent transependymal flow of CSF. 
There is nonspecific soft tissue nodularity along the body of the 
left lateral ventricle.  
 
Dysmorphic appearance of the ventricular system is noted, reflecting 
some combination of post treatment changes and mass effect from 
neoplasm.  
 
There is no midline shift.  
 
There is a hypodense subdural collection along the convexity of the 
right frontal lobe, without much mass effect on the underlying 
parenchyma, measuring 6 mm in maximum thickness.  
 
Dysconjugate gaze is noted.  
 
 
Impression
Extensive nodular soft tissue neoplasm, as detailed above, with mass 
effect on the right lateral ventricle, resulting in a trapped 
temporal horn, with moderate to severe distention.  Low attenuation 
surrounding the right temporal horn may represent transependymal flow 
of CSF. A contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain is recommended to 
further delineate the extent of disease.  
 
Nonspecific hypodense subdural collection along the convexity of the 
right frontal lobe, without much mass-effect, measuring 6 mm in 
thickness, may represent chronic subdural blood.  
 
Biparietal approach VP shunt catheters with the tips in the lateral 
ventricles.

encephalomalacia in the left parieto-occipital lobe with 
porencephalic cyst communicating with a large left occipital horn.  
 
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection.  There 
is dilatation of the ventricles and sulci which represent 
involutional changes, unchanged. There is stable encephalomalacia and 
loss of tissue likely from prior infarct in the left 
parieto-occipital region. There is a moderate periventricular white 
matter hypodensity compatible with chronic microvascular ischemic 
disease. The ventricles are stable in size without  evidence of 
hydrocephalus. There is no mass effect or midline shift.   
 
There is evidence of left parieto-occipital craniotomy with 
postsurgical change. No significant disease is noted in the paranasal

Clinical History
Charge syndrome. Clinical concern for infection.  
 
 
History and Indication
CHARGE SYNDROME-TRACH/VENT 
 
 
Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex without intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal 
reconstructions were obtained. 
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, focal 
extra-axial collection or acute territorial infarct.  
 
There is generalized loss of volume of the parenchymal with secondary 
prominence of the cortical sulci and ventricles, more than expected 
for the patient's age. There is asymmetric size of the lateral 
ventricles, left larger than the right, likely developmental. 
Incidental note is made of a cavum septum pellucidum and vergae. 
There is no mass effect or midline shift. The vermis is somewhat 
hypoplastic.  The posterior fossa is of not enlarged. There is a 
posterior fossa cyst which communicates with a prominent 4th 
ventricle, favored to represent a Blake's pouch remnant.   
 
The calvarium is intact.  The globes are elongated, compatible with 
colobomas, given the patient's history of CHARGE syndrome. 
Intra-articular silicone implants are present bilaterally. Enlarged 
vestibular aqueducts are noted, right more than left.  
 
There is underdevelopment of the mastoid air cells bilaterally. There 
is diffuse opacification of the middle ear cavities and the few 
developed mastoid air cells, bilaterally. Please correlate with 
direct visualization.  
 
There is diffuse opacification of the left the ethmoid air cells with 
air-fluid level in the left frontal sinus. Correlate clinically for 
acute sinusitis. Moderate mucosal thickening is noted in the 
posterior right ethmoid and right sphenoid sinus.  
 
 
Impression
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or focal extra-axial 
collection. Multiple developmental anomalies, as detailed above.  
 
Opacification of bilateral middle ear cavities and underdeveloped 
mastoid air cells. This is nonspecific. Given the clinical history, 
please correlate with direct visualization to exclude otitis media.  
 
Paranasal sinus decreases, as described above.

Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex without intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal 
reconstructions were obtained.  
 
Comparison
Head CT dated 09/26/2014.  
 
Findings
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, acute 
territorial infarct or focal extra-axial collection.  
 
There is generalized age related involutional changes with secondary 
prominence of the cortical sulci and ventricles. There is no mass 
effect, midline shift or hydrocephalus.  
 
There is low attenuation in the periventricular white matter and 
patchy areas of low attenuation scattered in the deep and subcortical 
white matter, which is similar to the prior exam, reflecting sequela 
of mild small vessel ischemia. Vascular calcifications are present 
along the right vertebral artery and both internal carotid artery 
siphons.  
 
The calvarium is intact.  
 
The left sphenoid sinus is opacified with obstruction of the 
sphenoethmoidal recess.  There is chronic osteitis of the left 
sphenoid sinus walls. Hyperdensity within the left sphenoid sinus may 
represent inspissated secretions and/ or superimposed fungal 
colonization. There is mild mucosal thickening along the anterior 
ethmoids and right sphenoid.  There is a retention cyst in the left 
maxillary sinus. Mastoid air cells are clear.  
 
Impression
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute territorial 
infarct. No mass effect, midline shift or hydrocephalus. Mild small 
vessel ischemic changes. Opacified left sphenoid sinus, as above.

Clinical History
Altered mental status, vomiting, with slurred speech.  
 
Technique
CT angio of the neck: Following rapid IV bolus of contrast material, 
rapid helical imaging with very thin slices from the aortic arch to 
the lower cranial level was performed. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was utilized to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
NASCET methodology was employed to evaluate the degree of stenosis. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Following rapid injection of intravenous 
contrast material after an appropriate delay, very thin helical axial 
slices were obtained through the entire head. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was employed to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
 
CT perfusion of the head: Cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, 
mean transit time, and IRF T0 mapping was obtained.  
 
Contrast
 
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison.  
 
Findings
CT angio of the neck: Evaluation of the aortic arch and its major 
branches demonstrate that the origin of the left vertebral artery 
from the aortic arch, a normal anatomic variant.  There is no 
evidence for stenosis or dissection in the visualized aorta or its 
major branches.  
 
Evaluation common carotid arteries demonstrate normal contour and 
caliber bilaterally without stenosis or evidence for dissection.  
 
Scattered punctate atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at 
bilateral carotid bifurcations without hemodynamically significant 
stenosis.  The remainder of the visualized cervical internal carotid 
artery demonstrates slightly tortuous course without stenosis or 
evidence for dissection.  
 
Evaluation of cervical vertebral arteries demonstrate normal contour 
and caliber without stenosis or evidence for dissection.  
 
CT angiography of the head: Evaluation of the intracranial internal 
carotid arteries demonstrate atherosclerotic calcifications in the 
cavernous and clinoid segments without hemodynamically significant 
stenosis or evidence for dissection.  
 
There is a dominant left A1 segment predominantly supplying bilateral 
C2 and distal ACA branches via normal-appearing anterior 
communicating artery. The right A1 segment is hypoplastic.  
 
There is prominent right posterior communicating artery predominantly 
supplying the right PCA territory.  The right P1 segment is 
hypoplastic.  
 
Variation of middle cerebral artery territory is demonstrated 
bilateral normal-appearing M1, M2, and distal MCA branches.  
 
There is atherosclerotic disease involving the distal P1 segment of 
the left PCA producing contour irregularity with mild to moderate 
stenosis. There are bilateral normal-appearing intracranial 
vertebral, basilar, and superior cerebellar arteries.  Bilateral 
normal appearing PICA are noted.  
 
No large vessel occlusion is seen. There is no evidence of aneurysm 
or vascular malformation.  
 
CT perfusion of the head: There is focal decrease in cerebral blood 
flow, cerebral blood volume, with a corresponding increase in mean 
transit time in the left occipital lobe corresponding to the area of 
suspected infarction on the concurrently performed CT of the head, 
consistent with infarction.  There is no significant mismatch between 
cerebral blood flow and mean transit time to suggest a large 
penumbra.  
 
Impression
CT angio of the neck: No evidence of hemodynamically significant 
stenosis or dissection.  
 
CT angiography of the head: No evidence of large vessel occlusion. 
Mild-to-moderate stenosis involving the left distal P1 segment, 
likely related to atherosclerotic disease. No evidence of 
intracranial aneurysm.  
 
CT perfusion: Perfusion abnormality consistent with infarction in the 
left occipital lobe corresponding to the hypodensity as visualized on 
prior head CT.

Motion artifact is noted on several images.  
 
Comparison
CT head without contrast from 03/23/2014. 
 
Findings
There is no loss of gray-white matter distinction or other sign of 
acute infarction. There is, however, evidence of an old infarction 
involving the left frontal lobe with annular tear watershed 
distribution as well as evidence of an old infarction involving the 
left parietal lobe in the posterior watershed distribution.  There is 
also evidence of a old right parietal lobe infarction within the left 
posterior watershed distribution. In addition there is tissue loss 
and gliosis within the right posterior temporal and occipital lobe 
compatible with old infarction which is better visualized on the 
current study due to differences in slice selection. There is also a 
tissue loss and gliosis within the right frontal lobe representing 
sequelae of prior infarction. There is also an old lacunar infarction 
involving the right thalamus. There evidence of old infarctions 
involving the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres. There is no new 
parenchymal abnormality. The ventricles, cisterns and sulci are 
age-appropriate in size. There is no mass effect or midline shift. 
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. The 
calvarium and skull base appear intact. There are polyps /mucous 
retention cysts in both maxillary sinuses.  The other visualized 
paranasal sinuses as well as the bile mastoids appear unremarkable.

Clinical History
Right-sided facial droop.  
 
 
History and Indication
FACIAL DROOP.  
 
 
Technique
1.  3D time-of-flight MR angiogram of the head was performed without 
intravenous contrast.  3D MIP reformations were obtained at a 
separate workstation.  
 
2.  3D time-of-flight MR angiogram of the neck was performed without 
intravenous contrast. 3D MIP reformations were obtained at a separate 
workstation.  
 
Comparison
No prior studies are available for comparison.   
 
Findings
MRA neck: Examination is limited by motion. Within these limitations 
there is no evidence of acute dissection in the carotid and vertebral 
arteries, within the neck. Extensive motion on the source images, 
most notably along the origins of the great vessels and at the 
takeoff of the vertebral and carotid arteries is extremely limited. 
The right internal carotid artery is asymmetrically smaller in size 
when compared with the left. There is approximately 45 - 50 percent 
stenosis at the origin of the right ICA. There is mild narrowing at 
the origin of the left ICA, with approximately 35 percent stenosis. 
The right vertebral artery is dominant. Cannot evaluate the V1 
segments of both vertebral arteries, because of the extensive motion.  
The V2 segments demonstrating normal course with no hemodynamically 
significant stenosis.   
 
MRA head: This examination is extremely limited by motion.  Within 
these limitations there is no occlusion or focal high-grade stenosis 
in the central arteries of the circle of Willis.  Cannot exclude 
aneurysm in the circle of Willis because of the extensive motion 
artifact. There is a patent right PICA, left AICA and bilateral 
superior cerebellar arteries. There no definite patent posterior 
communicating arteries, however, evaluation in this region is 
extremely limited by motion artifact.  There is a patent anterior 
communicating artery. No evidence of large AVM in the circle of 
Willis, however, given the extensive motion artifact small AVMs 
cannot be excluded.  
 
 
Impression
Examination is extremely limited by motion, as above.  
1. No occlusion or high-grade stenosis in the central arteries of the 
circle of Willis.  
2. Approximately 45- 50% stenosis at the origin of the right ICA and 
approximately 35% stenosis at the origin of the left ICA. Given the 
extensive motion and limitations of this exam, correlation with 
carotid duplex is suggested to better assess the hemodynamic 
significance.

Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
This examination is limited by motion on several sequences, secondary 
to motion, particularly on the FLAIR and T1 sequences.  
 
There is no evidence of restricted diffusion in the brain parenchyma

but may be the sequela of mild small vessel ischemia. Perivascular 
spaces and/or chronic lacune are infarcts are present in the right 
thalamus. Difficult to fully characterize these spaces given the 
extensive motion on FLAIR.  
 
Cannot assess for abnormal enhancement along the 7 nerve without

workstation technology was employed to create time of arrival, blood 
flow, mean transit time and blood volume color perfusion maps. 
 
CT angio of the neck: Following rapid IV bolus of contrast material, 
rapid helical imaging with very thin slices from the aortic arch to 
the lower cranial level was performed. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was utilized to create 3-D rendered MIP images.  NASCET 
methodology was employed to evaluate the degree of stenosis. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Following rapid injection of intravenous

Comparison
CT head from 01/16/2015  
 
Findings
 
Motion results in streak artifact and significant image degradation, 
significantly limiting evaluation, particularly affecting the middle 
and posterior cranial fossae.  
 
There is no definite CT evidence of acute territorial transcortical 
infarction, gross intracranial hemorrhage or obvious extra-axial 
collection. There is no mass effect or midline shift. 
Patchy foci of hypoattenuation within the periventricular and 
subcortical white matter without mass effect are most compatible with 
microvascular ischemic changes given presence of atherosclerotic 
calcifications at the skullbase. There are suspected 
age-indeterminate lacunar infarcts within the left centrum semiovale 
and corona radiata.  
 
 
 
The ventricles, cisterns and sulci are unchanged in size and 
configuration. 
 
Redemonstrated is a 1.1 cm partially calcified right parafalcine

CTA head and neck with perfusion. 
 
Clinical History
Left upper extremity weakness, left facial droop and aphasia. 
 
Technique
CT perfusion: During a contrast bolus injection, 16 5mm thick stacks 
of perfusion data were collected intracranially.Following this, 
workstation technology was employed to create blood flow, mean 
transit time and blood volume color perfusion maps. 
 
CT angio of the neck: Following rapid IV bolus of contrast material, 
rapid helical imaging with very thin slices from the aortic arch to 
the lower cranial level was performed. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was utilized to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
NASCET methodology was employed to evaluate the degree of stenosis. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Following rapid injection of intravenous 
contrast material after an appropriate delay, very thin helical axial 
slices were obtained through the entire head. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was employed to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent OMNIPAQUE 350 135 milliliters 12/23/2014 INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison.  
 
Findings
CT perfusion: No significant asymmetrical lobar perfusion deficit. 
Posterior periventricular white matter perfusion abnormalities 
related to the previous described lacunar infarcts.  
 
CT angio of the neck: There is no evidence of hemodynamically 
significant stenosis or occlusion of the right or left carotid 
arteries. The origins of the bilateral carotid arteries are intact.  
There is bilateral carotid artery calcification at the siphons. The 
origin of the right vertebral artery is patent. The right vertebral 
artery is dominant without stenosis or occlusion. The origin of the 
left vertebral artery is patent with the remainder of the left 
vertebral artery appearing hypoplastic.

History and Indication
LEFT SIDED WEAKNESS, APHASIA 
 
 
Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex without intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal 
reconstructions were obtained. 
 
Comparison
Head CT performed earlier the same day on 12/23/2014.  
 
Findings
Examination is somewhat limited by motion.  
 
There is no CT evidence of acute territorial infarct or acute 
intracranial hemorrhage. There is generalized age related 
involutional changes with secondary prominence of the cortical sulci 
and ventricles. There is confluent and patchy low attenuation within 
the deep and subcortical low-attenuation, similar to the prior exam, 
reflecting sequela of moderate small vessel ischemia. Scattered 
chronic lacunar infarcts within the right corona radiata, right basal 
ganglia, left cerebellum and bilateral posterior periventricular 
white matter. There are extensive vascular calcifications of both 
internal carotid artery siphons and along the right vertebral artery. 
There is no mass effect or midline shift. The ventricular system is 
unchanged in size with no evidence of hydrocephalus.  
 
The calvarium is intact. There is no significant disease in the 
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoids. 
 
 
Impression
No significant interval change from the exam performed earlier the 
same day. No evidence of acute territorial infarct or acute 
intracranial hemorrhage. Moderate small vessel ischemic changes with 
scattered chronic lacunar infarcts, as above.

Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex without intravenous contrast.  Coronal sagittal 
reconstructions were obtained. 
 
Comparison
Head CT dated 12/23/2014.  
 
Findings
Since the prior exam, there has been interval development of a 
well-defined zone of low attenuation in the paramedian right frontal 
lobe, with blurring of the gray-white matter interface. There are 
small areas of hemorrhage in this region. There is associated sulcal 
effacement in the region with minimal mass effect on the right 
frontal horn.  There is no midline shift.  No evidence of 
hydrocephalus.  
 
There is age-related generalized loss of volume of the parenchyma. 
There is confluence and patchy low attenuation within the deep and 
subcortical white matter, similar to the prior exam, reflecting 
moderate small vessel ischemic changes.  Scattered chronic lacunar 
infarcts are again noted in the right corona radiata, right basal 
ganglia, left cerebellum and bilateral posterior periventricular 
white matter. Extensive vascular calcifications are noted along both 
internal carotid artery siphons.  Vascular calcifications are also 
present along the intradural vertebral artery.  
 
The bony calvarium is intact. The visualized paranasal sinuses and 
mastoid air cells are well aerated.  
 
Impression
Since the prior exam, interval development of a acute right ACA 
territory infarct involving the paramedian right frontal lobe with 
small hemorrhage in the infarct. No midline shift.  
 
Findings were discussed with NP Grady at 8 a.m. on 12/27/2014.

Comparison
12/27/2014 
 
Findings
In addition to the previously noted acute infarct in the right 
anterior parasagittal frontal lobe with question of small focus of 
hemorrhage within it, there is now a large right MCA territory acute 
infarct involving the frontal and parietal lobes with loss of 
distinction between the gray and white matter, effacement of sulci 
and mass effect on the right lateral ventricle with minimal if any 
subfalcine shift to the left. There is no suggestion of hemorrhage 
within the MCA territory infarct. Again, a small area of at most 
minimal hyperdensity is suggested within the ACA territory infarcts 
in this man may not have represented hemorrhage. 
 
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus.  Involutional changes are 
again noted.  
 
The calvarium is intact. 
 
There is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses 
and mastoids.  
 
Impression
Large acute MCA territory infarct now noted in addition to the acute 
right frontal lobe infarct previously seen. No definite evidence of 
intracranial hemorrhage.

Comparison
CT head and MRI of the brain without contrast 11/07/2011 
 
Findings
There is no loss of gray-white matter distinction or other sign of 
acute infarction. There is slight increase in hypoattenuation in the 
periventricular and deep cortical white matter, consistent with 
chronic microvascular ischemic disease. Old lacunar infarct is seen 
within the left occipital lobe, unchanged.  
 
The ventricles unchanged in size and configuration with prominence of 
the temporal horns of the lateral ventricles. There is crowding of 
the gyri at the vertex.  
 
There is no mass effect, midline shift or other focal parenchymal 
abnormality.  
 
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. 
 
The calvarium is intact.  
 
Mild mucosal sinus disease is seen within the left sphenoid sinus.  
The remainder of the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoids are 
well pneumatized. 
 
Impression

     1. No acute intracranial pathology.
     2. Unchanged size and configuration of the dilated ventricular 
system with prominence of the temporal horns of the lateral 
ventricles. This finding in conjunction with crowding of the gyri at 
the vertex is suggestive of normal-pressure hydrocephalus.
     3. Slight interval worsening of periventricular and deep white 
matter hypodensity, compatible with chronic microvascular ischemic 
disease, possibly including a component of transependymal flow.

Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex without intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal 
reconstructions were obtained. 
 
Comparison
Head CT dated 05/20/2014.  
 
Findings
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute 
territorial infarction.  
 
Redemonstrated is loss of volume of the parenchyma, with secondary 
prominence of the cortical sulci and ventricles. There is relatively 
more volume loss of the frontal lobes.  Overall these findings than 
are similar to the prior exam.   
 
Ventricular system is stable in size and configuration without 
evidence of hydrocephalus.   
 
There is no mass effect or midline shift.   
 
There is confluent low attenuation in the periventricular white 
matter and patchy areas of low attenuation within the deep and 
subcortical white matter, similar to the prior exam, reflecting 
moderate small vessel ischemic changes.  There is a chronic lacunar 
infarct in the right frontal centrum semiovale, which is new since 
05/20/2014.  
 
Extensive vascular calcifications are present in both internal 
carotid artery siphons and along the intradural vertebral arteries. 
There is a partially empty sella turcica.  
 
The Bony calvarium is grossly intact. There is no significant disease 
in the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoids. 
 
Impression
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute territorial 
infarction. Moderate small vessel ischemic changes with interval 
development of a chronic lacunar infarct in right frontal deep white 
matter. No mass effect, midline shift or hydrocephalus.

History and Indication
Restaging of posterior fossa meningioma.  
 
Technique
A multisequential, multiplanar MRI of the brain was performed prior 
to and following the intravenous administration of 6 mL of Gadavist 
contrast.  
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent GADAVIST 6.1 milliliters 01/19/2015 INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
Comparison
Comparison is made with the outside MRI brain dated 01/15/2014 and 
01/23/2013.  
 
Findings
There are postsurgical changes of right retrosigmoid craniectomy and 
cranioplasty, with encephalomalacia and gliosis in the underlying 
right cerebellum.  There is a thin curvilinear extra-axial 
enhancement underlying the cranioplasty which is most likely 
postsurgical change. There is no suspicious nodular extra-axial 
enhancement to suggest recurrent neoplasm. Incidental note is made of 
asymmetric marrow within the right petrous apex.  
 
There is no restricted diffusion in the parenchymal to suggest an 
acute infarct. There is no enhancing intracranial mass lesion. There 
is no mass effect no midline shift. The ventricular system is stable 
in size and configuration with no evidence of hydrocephalus.  
 
There is a nonspecific punctate foci of susceptibility signal in the 
left parietal lobe, which may represent calcification or hemosiderin 
from prior micro hemorrhage. 
 
There are few punctate foci of T2/FLAIR signal scattered within the 
white matter of the frontal lobes, which are nonspecific, and has 
been described in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.  
Allowing for differences in technique, these are similar to the 
01/15/2014 MRI.  
 
The sella turcica is unremarkable.  There is no tonsillar herniation. 
The flow voids of the central arteries in the circle of Willis are 
present.

Facial paresthesia. Facial nerve palsy. Neurologic deficit.  
 
Technique
Multisequential, multiplanar MRI of the brain and posterior fossa was 
performed prior to and following the intravenous administration of 
6.7 mL of Gadavist contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions 
were obtained  
 
Comparison
MRI brain performed earlier the same day.  
 
Findings
There is no restricted diffusion in the parenchyma to indicate an 
acute infarction.  
 
There are no enhancing mass lesions within the parenchyma. There is a 
faint blush of enhancement in the subcortical white matter of the 
left frontal lobe (image 127 of series 19), favored to represent a 
capillary telangiectasia.  
 
There is a large extra-axial space along the right cerebellopontine 
angle, which follows CSF signal on all sequences and measures 
approximately 3.8 x 2.0 x 3.5 cm in AP, transverse and craniocaudal 
dimensions. This is most compatible with an arachnoid cyst.  There is 
mild associated mass effect and underlying cerebellum and middle 
cerebellar peduncle. There is a smaller extra-axial space along the 
inferior left CP angle, which follows CSF on all sequences and 
measures 1.7 x 1.2 x 1.8 cm in AP, transverse and craniocaudal 
dimensions.  This also likely reflects an arachnoid cyst. This is not 
associated with mass effect on the underlying parenchyma. There is no 
evidence of significant mass effect on cranial nerve 7/8 complexes, 
bilaterally.  
 
There are a few scattered nonspecific punctate foci of T2/FLAIR 
signal in the deep and subcortical white matter of the frontal lobes.  
These are nonspecific and have been reported in both symptomatic and 
asymptomatic patients common may be clinically insignificant.  
Alternative considerations include migraine headaches and very mild 
chronic small vessel ischemia.  
 
There is a partially empty sella turcica with the pituitary gland 
flattened along the floor and the infundibulum e somewhat displaced 
posteriorly. There is also mild asymmetric elevation of the pre 
chiasmatic right optic nerve as well as the right side of the optic 
chiasm. These findings likely represent a partially empty sella 
turcica. Arachnoid cyst is less likely.  
 
Cisternal segments of the trigeminal nerves and cranial nerve 7/8 
complexes are unremarkable.  There is normal symmetric T2 signal in 
the semicircular canals, vestibule and cochlea. No evidence of 
enhancing mass in the CP angle or internal auditory canals.  
Cavernous sinuses enhance symmetrically without bulge. There is no 
enhancing mass lesion in Meckel's caves.  
 
Flow voids in the central arteries of the circle of Willis are 
present.  
 
There are no fluid levels in the visualized paranasal sinuses or 
mastoid air cells. Visualized intraorbital contents are unremarkable.  

 
 
Impression
Bilateral CP angle arachnoid cysts, as described above, right larger

RIGHT FACIAL DROOP.  History of infarcts.  
 
Technique
A multisequential, multiplanar MRI of the brain was performed without 
intravenous contrast.  
 
Comparison
MRI brain dated 11/14/2014 
 
Findings
This examination is limited by motion on all sequences, particularly 
the T2 weighted images.  
 
Since the prior exam, there has been interval development of two 
punctate foci of hyperintense B1000 signal within the left cerebral 
peduncle and lateral left thalamus, which demonstrates corresponding 
isointense ADC signal and punctate foci of hyperintense T2 signal.  
 
There is continued evolution of the right PCA territory infarction 
with heterogeneous hyperintense T2/FLAIR signal and curvilinear 
restricted diffusion, similar to the prior exam. Curvilinear 
hyperintense T1 signal in the infarcted right occipital lobe may 
represent laminar necrosis. SWI sequence was not performed because of 
motion, thus limiting evaluation for blood products in this infarct.  
 
Redemonstrated are confluent areas of hyperintense FLAIR signal in 
the deep white matter and patchy areas of hyperintense T2/FLAIR 
signal in the subcortical white matter, gangliocapsular regions, 
midbrain palpable pulses at the middle cerebellar peduncle, 
reflecting the sequelae of moderate to severe chronic small vessel 
ischemia. Chronic lacunar infarcts are present within the left middle 
cerebellar peduncle, left thalamus, posterior left lentiform nucleus, 
scattered within the periventricular white matter and deep white 
matter of the inferior left frontal lobe. Old infarct in the 
posterior right cerebellum is present.

V4 segment of both vertebral arteries, however, this may be 
artifactual and secondary to extensive motion. Stenosis and/ or flow 
maps are however not excluded. Consider repeat MRA or 
contrast-enhanced CTA, if clinically warranted.  
 
Impression
Extremely limited study due to motion artifact, as above. Abrupt cut 
off of the left PCA, just after the takeoff of the P1 segment, as 
described above.

Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex without intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal 
reconstructions were obtained. 
 
Comparison
No prior head CT available for comparison. 
 
Findings
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute 
territorial infarction.  There is generalized loss of volume of the 
parenchyma secondary prominence of the cortical sulci and ventricles, 
more than expected for the patient's age. Please correlate with 
medical and social history. There are multiple patchy areas of low 
attenuation scattered throughout the deep and subcortical white 
matter of the frontal and parietal lobes. Some of these foci of low 
attenuation appear to be similar to CSF attenuation, and may 
represent chronic infarcts and /or perivascular spaces. There is no 
mass effect or midline shift. No evidence of hydrocephalus.  
 
Bony calvarium is grossly intact. There is a osteoma along the outer 
table of the right frontal calvarium, which measures 0.5 cm in 
thickness and 1.0 cm in length. Visualized paranasal sinuses and 
mastoid air cells are clear.  
 
 
Impression
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute territorial 
infarction. No mass-effect, midline shift or hydrocephalus.  
 
2. Multiple nonspecific foci of low attenuation within the deep and 
subcortical white matter, as described above. Differential 
considerations include infectious/inflammatory processes, vasculitis, 
small vessel ischemic changes and demyelinating process (less 
likely). Please correlate clinically. Alternatively, some of these 
foci of low attenuation may represent perivascular spaces.

Findings
There is no loss of gray-white matter distinction or other sign of 
acute infarction. There is again a small subdural collection along 
the right-sided falx, measuring up to 4 mm in thickness. Mild 
hemorrhage is also seen within the midline inferior frontal 
subarachnoid space. There is an old infarct in the left 
temporal/occipital lobe. The ventricles, cisterns and sulci are 
age-appropriate in size, representing advanced involutional changes. 
There is condyle and non confluent low attenuation in the deep and 
subcortical white matter and patchy areas of low attenuation in the 
ganglial capsular regions, bilaterally. These are most likely the 
sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemia. Vascular calcifications 
are present in both vertebral arteries and both internal carotid 
artery siphons. Basilar artery is still dolichoectatic. There is no 
mass effect, midline shift or hydrocephalus.  
 
The calvarium is intact. 
 
There is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses

Findings
Motion results in streak artifact and significant image degradation, 
limiting evaluation. Images through the middle and posterior cranial 
fossae are nearly nondiagnostic.  
 
Compared to the prior examination, the right parafalcine subdural 
hematoma near the vertex is decreased in thickness, now measuring 
approximately 2 millimeters. There has been minimal interval decrease 
in intraventricular hemorrhage layering within the occipital horns of 
the lateral ventricles. Given limitations of the study, there is no 
definite new intracranial hemorrhage, extra-axial collection or CT 
evidence of transcortical infarction.  
 
 
Involutional changes and chronic microvascular ischemic changes are 
again noted. There is no change in the size and configuration of the 
ventricles.  Again noted is a calcified sebaceous cyst within the 
suboccipital scalp just right of midline.  There is also evidence of

CT HEAD ROUTINE WITHOUT CONTRAST  
 
Clinical History
Intracranial hemorrhage, follow up evaluation  
 
 
Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex. 
 
Comparison
Head CT from 10/16/2014  
 
Findings
There is near complete resolution of the right parafalcine subdural 
hematoma near the vertex. There remains minimal intraventricular 
hemorrhage layering within the occipital horns of the lateral 
ventricles. There is no new intracranial hemorrhage, extra-axial 
collection or CT evidence of transcortical infarction.  
 
Involutional changes and chronic microvascular ischemic changes are 
again noted. There is no change in the size and configuration of the 
ventricles.  Again noted is a calcified sebaceous cyst within the 
suboccipital scalp just right of midline.  There is also evidence of 
a tiny calcified meningioma adjacent to the right sylvian cistern.  
This is remained stable in size and appearance. Again noted is a 
prominent perivascular space in the region of the right anterior 
commissure.  
 
Calvarium is intact. The mastoid air cells are clear bilaterally.  
There is no significant mucosal thickening throughout the visualized 
paranasal sinuses. The partially visualized orbits are grossly 
unremarkable.  
 
Impression
No significant change from the prior examination.

Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
 
There is no loss of gray-white matter distinction or other sign of 
acute infarction. 
 
The ventricles, cisterns and sulci are age-appropriate in size. 
 
There is a small rounded amorphous calcification just deep to the 
calvaria in the anterior right temporal parietal region as seen on 
image 25, series 2. This is nonspecific but are likely to be related 
to acute injury or acute pathology.  
 
No evidence of parenchymal contusion or intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  
 
There is no mass effect, midline shift or other acute focal 
parenchymal abnormality.  
 
The hyperdensity deep in the left frontal bone fracture is likely at 
least partially secondary to streak artifact.  However, there is also 
a probable punctate extra-axial hemorrhage without significant mass 
effect (see axial images 41-42, series 2). There is no evidence of 
other intra- or extra-axial intracranial hemorrhage. 
 
See separately dictated facial bone report for discussion of facial 
bone and frontal bone fracturess, paranasal sinuses, and extra 
calvarial soft tissues.  
 
 
Impression
Suggestion of possible punctate extra-axial hemorrhage adjacent to 
the left frontal bone fracture, although this area is limited by 
streak artifact. No mass effect or midline shift. No evidence of 
other extra-axial hemorrhage or collection. 
 
No intraparenchymal hemorrhage or contusion.

similar to the prior exam, likely attributed to chronic small vessel 
ischemic changes.  Vascular calcifications are present in both 
internal carotid artery siphons and in the intracranial left 
vertebral artery. .  
 
Unchanged amorphous calcifications in the anterior right temporal 
parietal lobe, just deep to the calvarial. Additional scattered 
punctate calcifications is noted superiorly in the right sylvian 
fissure. These are unchanged from the prior exam and likely reflect 
prior injury/infection (i.e. neurocysticercosis).  
 
Comminuted fracture of the left frontal bone is again seen at the 
vertex, with a few minimally depressed fragment, overall similar in 
appearance to the prior exam. There is improving overlying soft 
tissue edema/hematoma.  
 
There has also been interval decreased left preseptal hematoma with 
decreasing retrobulbar gas. There are persistent fractures in the 
floor of the left orbit and left lamina papyracea. Fracture extends 
through the infraorbital canal. There is inferior herniation of the 
retrobulbar fat into the maxillary sinus, with focal thickening of 
the inferior rectus muscle, suggestive of intramuscular hematoma. 
Tethered contour of the inferior rectus muscle at this level.  
 
There is opacification of the anterior left ethmoids and there is a 
small hemorrhagic fluid level in the left maxillary sinus.  
 
Impression
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. Comminuted fracture of 
left frontal bone, as above, not significantly changed from 
01/08/2015.   
 
Fractures involving the floor and medial wall of the left orbit with 
decreasing retrobulbar gas and hematoma. Focal thickening of the 
inferior rectus muscle, suggestive of intramuscular hematoma.  
Correlate clinically to exclude left inferior rectus muscle 
entrapment.

Clinical History
Multiple sclerosis, followup evaluation.  
 
Technique
Multiple sequences were obtained through the brain without and with 
intravenous gadolinium. 
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent GADAVIST 10 milliliters 01/12/2015 INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
Comparison
MRI brain from 12/29/2012 .  
 
Findings
There are multiple T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesions within the 
bihemispheric subcortical, periventricular and subcortical white 
matter, in a distribution and appearance compatible with 
demyelinating disease. Numerous lesions demonstrate T1 hypointensity 
consistent with chronicity. Multiple lesions are ovoid in morphology 
and oriented perpendicular to the lateral ventricles. There is 
involvement of the corpus callosum as well as infratentorial white 
matter, with lesions noted within the left cerebellar hemisphere and 
the right medulla. No definite new or enhancing lesions are noted.  
 
The ventricles and the cisterns appear stable. There is no mass 
effect or midline shift. There is no acute infarction, intracranial 
hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. No abnormal contrast 
enhancement is noted in the brain or leptomeninges.  
There is no significant disease in the paranasal sinuses. The orbits 
are grossly unremarkable. The mastoid air cells are clear.  
 
 
Impression
Multiple supratentorial and infratentorial lesions in a distribution 
and appearance compatible with multiple sclerosis. No definite new or 
enhancing lesions to suggest active demyelination.

Clinical History
Left eye visual loss.  
 
Technique
Noncontrast CT head: Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the 
skull base to the vertex without contrast. 
 
CT angio of the neck: Following rapid IV bolus of contrast material, 
rapid helical imaging with very thin slices from the aortic arch to 
the lower cranial level was performed. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was utilized to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
NASCET methodology was employed to evaluate the degree of stenosis. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Following rapid injection of intravenous 
contrast material after an appropriate delay, very thin helical axial 
slices were obtained through the entire head. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was employed to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent OMNIPAQUE 350 105 milliliters 01/06/2015 INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
Comparison
No prior brain or neck imaging available for comparison.  
 
Findings
Noncontrast CT head: There is a right frontal craniectomy defect.  
Directly subjacent to this there is a focal parenchymal volume loss 
involving the right frontal lobe, postsurgical in nature. There are 
multiple scattered parenchymal calcifications which may be vascular 
or post infectious in nature. There is no definitive evidence of 
acute infarct.  There is no intracranial hemorrhage.  There is 
diffuse white matter hypodensity indicative of small vessel disease. 
There is no ventricular enlargement. There is no midline shift.  
There is partial opacification of the left mastoid air cells. There 
is moderate sinus disease in the ethmoid sinus and maxillary sinuses. 
There is evidence of bilateral lens surgery. There is soft tissue in 
the right external and middle ear cavities which can be further 
evaluated.  
 
CT angio of the neck: There is an overall poor contrast bolus which 
limits evaluation. There is 75 percent stenosis at the origin of the 
right ICA secondary to dense circumferential calcified plaque. There 
is decreased opacification of the left vertebral artery versus the 
right. This is most apparent as on image 152 series 6. Also at the 
upper left vertebral artery, there is suggestion of vessel wall mural 
thickening. There is a short segment of the left vertebral artery 
narrowing, in the V4 segment, best seen on image 133 of series 6.  
 
Incidental findings: There is emphysema in the lungs with thick 
pleural parenchymal apical thickening.  There is a focal 
pleural-based nodule in the right upper lobe which measures 4 mm, 
image 40 series 6.  A followup non contrast low-dose chest CT is 
recommended. The main pulmonary artery is prominent as 31 mm 
indicative of pulmonary arterial hypertension.  
 
CT angiography of the head: There is no evidence of aneurysm, AVM or 
vascular occlusive disease. The bilateral ophthalmic arteries are 
patent. There is a fetal left PCA.  
 
Impression
Noncontrast CT head: Frontal craniectomy with focal parenchymal 
volume loss in the right posterior frontal lobe.  Correlate with 
prior surgery. Multiple scattered parenchymal calcifications which 
may be vascular in nature. No CT evidence of acute territorial 
infarct or intracranial hemorrhage. Extensive sinus disease.  
 
CT angio of the neck: At least 75 percent stenosis at the origin of 
the right ICA secondary to calcified plaque. Decreased opacification 
of the left vertebral artery in the upper neck with focal narrowing 
and suggestion of mural thickening in the V3 and V4 aspects. Findings 
suggest possible subacute partial intimomedial dissection. Consider 
MRI to evaluate for possible diffusion restricting within the brain 
parenchyma.  
 
CT angiography of the head: No evidence of aneurysm or AVM.  Patent 
symmetric intracranial vasculature. Soft tissue in the right middle 
ear cavity which is incompletely evaluated due to technique.  If this 
is of clinical concern, recommend further workup with temporal bone 
CT or MRI.  
 
Incidental findings: Right lung nodule. Nonemergent followup non 
contrast low-dose chest CT is recommended. Findings compatible with 
pulmonary arterial hypertension.

History and Indication
SEPSIS 
 
 
Technique
Contiguous axial CT images of the brain were obtained without 
intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were 
obtained.  
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
This examination is somewhat limited by motion, particularly in 
evaluation of the posterior fossa and middle cranial fossa. There is 
no CT evidence of acute transcortical infarct. There is no evidence 
of acute intracranial hemorrhage.  There is no mass effect, midline 
shift or hydrocephalus. Vascular calcifications are present in both 
internal carotid artery siphons. The bony calvarium is grossly intact 
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  The 
optic globes are mildly proptotic. This is nonspecific, please 
correlate clinically. There is a well-defined 2.0 x 1.5 cm fat 
attenuation mass in the midline suboccipital soft tissues, most 
compatible with a lipoma.  
 
Impression
No CT evidence of acute territorial infarct or acute intracranial 
hemorrhage. No mass-effect, midline shift or hydrocephalus.  If there 
is continued clinical concern for acute infarct, then MRI may be 
obtained.

WEAKNESS 
 
 
Technique
A multi sequential, multiplanar MRI of the brain was performed 
without intravenous contrast.  
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
There are multiple punctate foci of restricted diffusion with 
corresponding hyperintense FLAIR signal, scattered within the white 
matter of the frontoparietal lobes, within the left cerebellum, left 
occipital lobe, thalami, right hippocampus, pons and cerebellar 
peduncles. 
 
There is no mass effect, midline shift or hydrocephalus.  
 
There is no focal extra-axial collection.  
 
There is a single small focus of susceptibility artifact in the high 
right parietal lobe which may be the sequelae of old micro 
hemorrhage.  
 
Sella turcica is unremarkable. There is no tonsillar herniation. The 
flow voids of the central arteries and the circle of Willis are 
present.  
 
There are no fluid levels in the visualized paranasal sinuses or 
mastoid air cells. The optic globes are mildly proptotic. Please 
correlate clinically.  
 
 
Impression
Multiple punctate acute infarcts scattered throughout the 
supratentorial and infratentorial parenchymal, as above.  These are 
most likely embolic. No mass effect or midline shift.

MRA neck: There is no evidence of dissection on fat saturated axial 
T1 weighted images. The right vertebral artery is dominant. There is 
mild narrowing at the origin of the left ICA. There is no greater 
than 30 percent stenosis in the carotid or the vertebral arteries, 
within the neck.  
 
Circle of Willis: There is no occlusion or hemodynamically 
significant stenosis in the anterior and posterior circulations. 
Right vertebral artery is dominant. There is a patent left posterior 
communicating artery. On the right, there are two branches arising 
from the supraclinoid right ICA, which course posteriorly to the 
right PCA, representing duplicated PCOMs. The medial right PCOM 
communicates with the P1 segment and the lateral right PCOM branch 
provides flow to the P2 and distal cortical branches of the right 
PCA. There is no evidence of aneurysm or gross AVM in the circle of 
Willis.

Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex. 
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
Comminuted fractures of the left frontal bone extending into the left 
parietal bone is seen.  There is partial distraction of the left 
parietal bone with severe comminution at the vertex. There is also a 
comminuted fracture of the occipital bone. Nondisplaced fracture of 
the right parietal bone is also visualized. There is a large left 
frontoparietal scalp hematoma with maximal thickness of approximately 
2 cm.  Multiple locules of soft tissue air as well as pneumocephalus 
are visualized adjacent to the fracture fragments.  
 
Although incompletely imaged, there is a fracture of the lateral wall 
of the left orbit with extensive air within the retrobulbar fat of 
the left orbit. There is also disruption of the left lamina papyracea 
with hyperdensity within the ethmoid air cells, likely hemorrhage in 
the setting of trauma.  
 
There is diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage. There is a 1 x 0.5 cm focus 
of hyperdensity in the right parietal lobe which may represent a 
focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage versus hemorrhagic contusion. No 
extra-axial collections are visualized.  
 
There is diffuse loss of gray white matter differentiation, likely 
secondary to extensive vasogenic edema in the setting of trauma and 
intracranial hemorrhage. 
 
The ventricles, cisterns and sulci are age-appropriate in size.

Findings
There are postoperative changes consistent with interval bifrontal 
craniectomy.  Again noted are fractures involving the bilateral 
parietal calvarium, the squamous portion of the right  temporal 
calvarium and the left frontal calvarium extending into the within 
the lateral wall of the left orbit. There is no worsening diffuse 
cerebral edema. There is no change degree of subarachnoid hemorrhage.  
There are evolving hemorrhagic contusions within the bilateral and 
inferior frontal lobes as well as the right anterior temporal lobe. 
There is also evolving contusions involving the bilateral parietal 
lobes near the vertex. The hemorrhagic contusions of increased 
slightly in size in comparison to the previous study. Again noted is 
evidence of cerebellar tonsillar ectopia with the cerebellar tonsils 
protruding approximately 7 mm below the foramen magnum.  This is 
remained stable in comparison to the previous study. This could 
represent evidence of a Chiari malformation or downward herniation. 
Again noted is significant soft tissue involving the left temporal 
scalp, the left frontal scalp, the left parietal scalp in the left 
periorbital soft tissues.  There are hemorrhagic air-fluid levels 
within both maxillary sinuses consistent with the patient's history 
of multiple facial bone fractures.  There is an interval placement of 
a right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter which transverses 
the right frontal lobe which and enters the frontal horn right 
lateral ventricle.  Its tip lies within the posterior aspect of the 
frontal horn right lateral ventricle.  Both lateral ventricles as 
well as the 3rd ventricle and 4th ventricle appear slit-like. There 
is effacement of the suprasellar cisterns as well as the ambient 
cistern and quadrigeminal plate cisterns. There has been interval 
placement of an ICP monitor via the  right frontal approach.  
 
 
Impression
Postoperative changes consistent with a bifrontal craniectomy.  
Interval progression of cerebral edema with effacement of the basal 
cisterns. Stable subarachnoid hemorrhage. Interval increase in the

 CT ANGIO HEAD AND NECK WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST INCLUDING POST 
PROCESSING  
 
Clinical History
Vertigo. Punctate late subacute infarct seen in the pons on MRI.  For 
evaluation of possible basilar artery stenosis.  
 
Technique
Noncontrast CT head: Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the 
skull base to the vertex without contrast. 
 
CT angio of the neck: Following rapid IV bolus of contrast material, 
rapid helical imaging with very thin slices from the aortic arch to 
the lower cranial level was performed. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was utilized to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
NASCET methodology was employed to evaluate the degree of stenosis. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Following rapid injection of intravenous 
contrast material after an appropriate delay, very thin helical axial 
slices were obtained through the entire head. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was employed to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
 
CT perfusion was performed in the usual fashion.  
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent OMNIPAQUE 350 125 milliliters 01/07/2015 INTRAVENOUS 
 
Comparison
Comparison to prior PET-CT from 08/28/2012 and MRI of the brain from 
01/06/2015.  
 
Findings
Noncontrast CT head:  
There is no CT evidence for acute territorial infarct. There is no 
intracranial hemorrhage. There is no hydrocephalus. There is evidence 
of mild small vessel disease. There is no mass effect, midline shift. 
There is no extra-axial collection. The calvarium is intact. There is 
no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses and 
mastoids. 
 
CT angio of the neck:  
There is no evidence of any stenosis or occlusion of the right or 
left carotid and vertebral arteries. 
 
CT angiography of the head:  
There is no evidence of aneurysm or AVM.  
 
There is a short focal segment of moderate to severe basilar stenosis 
in its mid portion measuring approximately 4 millimeters in 
longitudinal dimension. This is best appreciated on image 41, series 
603 (the sagittal MIP imaging).  The non stenotic basilar artery 
transaxial dimension is approximately 2 mm.  The stenotic portion 
transaxial diameter is approximately 0.5 mm.  
 
There is a fetal origin left PCA. There is apparent fetal origin of 
the right PCA with a hypoplastic right P1 segment.  Please see image 
110 of series 602. The bilateral superior cerebellar arteries are 
patent.  
 
CT perfusion:  
There is apparent slight asymmetry and mean transit time and blood 
flow in the cerebellum which is likely due to slice selection. There 
is subtle perfusion deficit in the right pons with increased mean 
transit time and decreased cerebral blood flow. There is no otherwise 
perfusion abnormality seen.  
 
Incidental findings:  
There is a 5 mm nodule in the right upper lobe, image 25 of series 5. 
This should be further investigated with a low-dose noncontrast chest 
CT non emergently. There is a 1.7 cm nodule in the right thyroid 
gland which needs clinical correlation and possible workup with 
ultrasound.  
 
 
Impression
Noncontrast CT head: No CT evidence of acute lobar infarction or 
intracranial hemorrhage. Subtle perfusion deficit in the right pons. 
CT angio of the neck: No evidence of significant stenosis in the 
bilateral carotid and vertebral arteries.  
CT angiography of the head: Short-segment (4 mm longitudinal extent) 
of basilar artery high-grade stenosis of approximately 75% percent as 
described. Bilateral fetal origins of the posterior cerebral 
arteries.  
Incidental findings: there is a 5 mm nodule in the right upper lobe, 
image 25 of series 5. This should be further investigated with a

Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex. 
 
Comparison
CT head from 01/15/2014  
 
Findings
There is no CT evidence of acute transcortical infarction, 
intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. There is no mass 
effect or midline shift.  
 
There is mild to moderate cerebral and cerebellar volume loss. This 
is out of proportion to moderate ventriculomegaly with rounding of 
the frontal horns and 3rd ventricle and prominence of the temporal 
horns as well as bowing of the corpus callosum, without significant 
change from the prior study.  
Patchy foci of hypoattenuation within the periventricular and 
subcortical white matter without mass effect are most compatible with 
moderate microvascular ischemic changes given presence of 
atherosclerotic calcifications at the skullbase. There are suspected 
small foci of cortical infarction again seen within the genu of the 
left internal capsule and anterior limb of the right external capsule 
and the right external capsule as well as the right thalamus. There 
are additionally lacunar infarcts within the right centrum semiovale 
(series 2, image 34) and right corona radiata (axial image 32) which 
were not definitively seen on the prior CT of the head.  
 
 
The calvarium and skull base appear intact. There is no significant 
disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoids. Visualized 
orbits are unremarkable.  
 
 
Impression
Moderate microvascular ischemic disease and lacunar infarcts, with 
age-indeterminate lacunar infarcts within the right centrum semiovale 
/corona radiata new from the prior study from 1 year ago. 
Diffusion-weighted MRI is significantly more sensitive for acute 
ischemia.  
Suggestion of communicating hydrocephalus.

Findings
Again seen are bifrontal approach ventriculostomy catheters, the left 
terminating in the occipital horn of the left lateral ventricle and 
the other terminating in the body of the right lateral ventricle, 
which are unchanged in position.  There is no significant change in 
ventricular size. 
 
Again seen is enhancing mass in the region of the septum pellucidum, 
foramen of Monro, and left frontal horn, measuring approximately 4.0 
x 3.0 cm, which is essentially unchanged from previous study ordered 
for differences in technique. The mass demonstrates cystic and solid 
components. There are areas of hypoattenuation within the left 
frontal and temporal lobes likely representing vasogenic edema which 
is better seen on the prior MR study.

Clinical History
New onset seizure.  
 
 
History and Indication
NEW SEIZURE 
 
 
Technique
A multi sequential, multiplanar MRI of the brain was performed 
without intravenous contrast, using the seizure protocol.  
 
Comparison
No prior MRI brain available for comparison. 
 
Findings
This examination is limited by motion on multiple sequences, most 
notably on the angled coronal T2 images through the medial temporal 
lobes.  
 
There is no restricted diffusion in the brain parenchyma to suggest 
an acute infarction.  
 
There are multiple foci of T2/FLAIR signal scattered within the deep 
and subcortical white matter and within the brainstem.  Although 
nonspecific, these likely represent the sequela of mild chronic 
small-vessel ischemia.  
 
Extensive motion artifact results in significant degradation of the 
T2 coronal images through the hippocampal formations. The fornices 
are symmetric.  There is no definite signal abnormality in the 
hippocampal formations, however, evaluation is significantly limited. 
There is mild asymmetric fullness of the left temporal horn (image 46 
of the axial T2 series). This is nonspecific, and may be clinically 
significant.  Alternatively, this may be secondary to asymmetric 
volume loss in the medial left temporal lobe. Please correlate with 
the EEG.  
 
There is no intra parenchymal susceptibility artifact to suggest the 
presence of hemosiderin.  
 
There is no mass effect or midline shift.  There is no hydrocephalus.  

 
There is a partially empty sella turcica.  There is no tonsillar 
herniation. The flow voids in the central arteries of the circle of 
Willis are present.  
 
There is mild mucosal thickening present throughout the visualized 
paranasal sinuses. The visualized intraorbital contents are 
unremarkable.  
 
Impression
Limited examination, as above. No evidence of acute infarction or 
space occupying mass lesion. Evaluation of the hippocampal formations 
is extremely limited by motion, however, there is no definite 
evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis.  
Nonspecific mild asymmetric fullness of the left temporal horn, as 
described above.  Please correlate with EEG.

Comparison
No prior studies are available for comparison.   
 
Findings
MRA neck: Examination is somewhat limited by motion. There is no 
evidence of dissection of the carotid or vertebral arteries in the 
neck. The origins of the great vessels are patent off the aortic 
arch.  
 
Right common carotid artery: the origin is patent. Normal course and 
caliber with no hemodynamically significant stenosis.  
Right internal carotid artery: Approximately 45 - 50% stenosis at the 
origin, followed by a second short-segment stenosis, measuring 
approximately 40% 
Right external carotid artery: Unremarkable.  
 
Left common carotid artery: the origin is patent.  Normal course and 
caliber with no hemodynamically significant stenosis.  
Left internal carotid artery: Approximately 55 % stenosis at the 
origin.  
Left external carotid artery: unremarkable.  
 
Overall the vertebral arteries are both diminutive in caliber.  The 
left vertebral artery is relatively dominant. There is no 
hemodynamically significant stenosis. The right vertebral artery 
becomes extremely hypoplastic after takeoff of the PICA.  
 
MRA circle of Willis: Examination is somewhat limited by motion.  
 
Anterior circulation: There is no occlusion or high-grade stenosis in 
the central MCA or ACA segments. There prominent patent bilateral 
posterior communicating arteries, with fetal origin of the posterior 
cerebral arteries.  
 
Posterior circulation: Diminutive vertebrobasilar system secondary to 
fetal origin of both PCAs. There are patent bilateral superior 
cerebellar arteries, AICAs and PICAs. There is no occlusion or 
high-grade stenosis in the central arteries of the posterior 
circulation.  Evaluation of the posterior cerebral arteries distal to 
the P2, is extremely limited by motion.  
 
Aneurysms cannot be excluded in the circle of Willis, because of the 
extensive motion artifact. No evidence of gross AVM in the circle of 
Willis.  
 
Impression
Limited exam, as above.  
 
1. Approximately 45-50% stenosis at the origin of the right ICA and 
approximately 55% stenosis of the origin of the left ICA. A carotid 
duplex may be obtained to better assess the hemodynamic significance, 
if clinically warranted.  
 
2. No occlusion or high-grade stenosis in the central arteries of the 
circle of Willis.

Contrast
Contrast Agent GADAVIST 6.4 milliliters 01/30/2015 INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
Comparison
08/22/2012 
 
Findings
Again noted is a cyst sitting immediately superior to the pituitary 
gland which measures 7 x 6 x 7 mm in size and is unchanged from the 
prior study. It is of intermediate signal on T1 weighted images and 
is very high in signal on FLAIR. There is partial enhancement of the 
rim of the cyst but no internal enhancement. The cyst projects only 
minimally suprasellar and does not even come close to the optic 
chiasm. The findings are again consistent with a Rathke's cleft cyst. 
The pituitary gland is normal in size and appearance without evidence 
of tumor. The pituitary stalk is normal. No  parasellar abnormality 
is noted.  
 
The ventricles are normal in size. There is mild cerebral cortical 
and cerebellar vermian atrophy, somewhat advanced for age.  Correlate 
with medical and surgical history.  
There is no mass effect, midline shift or focal parenchymal 
abnormality.  
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection.  
No abnormal contrast-enhancement is noted in the brain or

There is no significant disease in the paranasal sinuses.  
The orbits are unremarkable except for artifact related to mascara.  
 
Impression
No interval change in Rathke's cleft cyst. 
Atrophy somewhat prominent for age.

Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the

Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
There is no loss of gray-white matter distinction or other sign of 
acute territorial infarction. There is no evidence of acute 
intracranial hemorrhage.  There is no focal extra-axial collections.  
 
The ventricle and sulci are prominent for patient's age, correlate 
with social and medical history. There is mild ventriculomegaly of 
the lateral, 3rd and 4th ventricles, some of which may be 
artifactual.  However, there is a variability in the sulcal widening, 
with rounding of the frontal horns and mild bowing of the corpus 
callosum.  These findings may be seen in patients with normal 
pressure hydrocephalus. Please correlate clinically.  
 
There is no mass effect or midline shift.  
 
There mild patchy foci of low attenuation scattered within the deep 
and subcortical white matter, nonspecific, but possibly the sequela 
of mild small vessel ischemia.  Some of the low attenuation in the 
periventricular white matter may be transependymal flow of CSF in the 
setting of normal-pressure hydrocephalus.  
 
The calvarium is intact.  Vascular calcifications are present in both 
internal carotid artery siphons. The sella turcica is expanded and 
partially empty. 
 
There is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses 
and mastoids. 
 
Impression
No evidence of acute territorial infarction or acute intracranial 
hemorrhage.  
 
 Volume loss in the parenchyma, advanced for the patient's age.  
Please correlate with medical in social history.  
 
Mildly prominent ventricular system, as described above.  Although 
some of this may be ex vacuo, a communicating hydrocephalus cannot be 
excluded. Please correlate clinically to assess for possible normal 
pressure hydrocephalus.

known lung metastatic disease.  
 
 
History and Indication
POSSIBLE CVA 
 
 
Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex. 
 
Comparison
06/18/2014. In addition, MRI of the brain performed 06/18/2014 was 
reviewed. 
 
Findings
In the left temporal lobe there is a rounded masslike structure 
measuring 5.0 x 4.5 centimeters. There is low-attenuation comprising 
the bulk of this structure with high attenuation material seen 
heterogeneously intermixed with low attenuation material laterally 
and dependently.  There is some indication of layering versus 
capsular restriction of the high attenuation material which may 
represent blood within the mass. The surrounding brain tissue 
demonstrates low-attenuation changes associated with edema. There is 
compressive effacement on the left lateral ventricle which extends to 
the anterior horn.  There is approximately 4 millimeter of rightward 
midline deviation.  
 
The ventricles, cisterns and sulci are age-appropriate in size. 
 
There is no mass effect, midline shift or  focal parenchymal 
abnormality.  
 
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. 
 
The calvarium is intact.  
 
There is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses 
and mastoids. 
 
Impression
5.0 x 4.5 centimeter masslike structure in the left temporal lobe. 
High attenuation within this structure likely represents acute 
hemorrhage.  Although this finding could represent an acute 
hemorrhage alone, given the patient's history an underlying mass with 
hemorrhage should be ruled out. Surrounding edema and 4 millimeters 
of midline shift to the right. The previous CT scan and MRI of the 
brain dated 06/18/2014 demonstrated no pathology in the left temporal 
lobe at that time. MRI with contrast is recommended for further 
evaluation. 
 
The above findings were discussed with the physician caring for the 
patient in the emergency department at the time of image acquisition.

Findings
The patient is status post left temporal, frontal, and parietal 
craniotomy. There has been interval resection of the previously noted 
hemorrhagic mass involving predominantly the left temporal lobe. 
There is a resection cavity in this region with associated areas of 
hyperdensity likely representing hemorrhage. There is possible 
residual tumor along the superior margin (image 33, series 2) of the 
resection cavity. There likely scattered areas of subarachnoid 
hemorrhage predominantly within the left temporal region. There is 
decreased mass effect upon the left lateral ventricle. There is no 
significant midline shift. There is a small mixed density extra-axial 
collection between the dura and the calvarial defect measuring 
approximately 4 mm in its maximum dimension.  There is some mass 
effect upon the underlying brain parenchyma. There are stable areas 
of hypoattenuation within the left frontal, left parietal, and left 
temporal lobes. There is pneumocephalus.  
 
There are involutional changes without hydrocephalus.  There is small 
vessel disease.  There are multiple vascular calcifications.  There 
is no CT evidence of acute territorial infarct. The basal cisterns 
are patent.  
 
There is mild nodular mucosal thickening within both ethmoid and both 
maxillary sinuses.  There is no significant mastoid air cell disease. 
 
Impression
Interval at least partial resection of the previously noted 
predominantly left temporal lobe tumor.  Possible residual tumor 
along the superior margin of the resection cavity.  Correlation with 
MRI with contrast is recommended as well as the patient is 
compatible. Decreased mass effect upon the left lateral ventricle.  
Postsurgical changes as described above including pneumocephalus, 
extra-axial collection, and intracranial hemorrhage.

Findings
There is evidence of recent left craniotomy. Deep to the craniotomy 
is a fluid-filled surgical cavity with the tumor previously you 
resided. There is a small amount of contrast enhancement at the 
margin of the surgical cavity anteriorly and also superiorly which is 
different in appearance than the enhancement of the margin of tumor 
on the preoperative study and therefore may represent postoperative 
enhancement. The possibility that this represents residual tumor 
cannot be entirely excluded. There is no significant hemorrhage in 
the surgical area. There is edema around the surgical cavity and also 
restricted diffusion noted possibly posterior and superior to the 
surgical cavity. This may also be postoperative in nature. There is 
extension of FLAIR hyperintensity in to the left thalamus. There is 
minimal fluid collection deep to the craniotomy.  
There is decrease in mass effect is on the left lateral ventricle and 
correction of the subfalcine shift. There is residual effacement of 
sulci and the sylvian fissure in the area of previous tumor and 
surgery. 
The ventricles are small.  
There are scattered foci of FLAIR hyperintensity in the bilateral 
cerebral white matter consistent with mild small vessel disease.  
No other abnormal contrast enhancement is noted in the brain or 
leptomeninges. 
The pituitary gland is normal in size. 
Normal flow void is noted in the major arteries of the circle of 
Willis.  
There is no significant disease in the paranasal sinuses. 
The orbits are grossly unremarkable status post cataract surgery. 
 
Impression
Postsurgical changes as described. No definite evidence of residual 
tumor.  Small area of contrast enhancement which may be postsurgical 
in nature but residual tumor cannot be entirely excluded at these

Again noted is a large heavily calcified suprasellar mass which has 
remained stable in size appearance, likely representing a 
craniopharyngioma.   
 
Again noted postoperative changes consistent with a craniectomy 
involving the squamous portion the right temporal calvarium. There is 
an old healed craniotomy defect involving the left frontal and 
temporal calvarium.  Hyperostosis frontalis interna is noted 
bilaterally. The calvarium is otherwise intact as is the skullbase. 
There is tissue loss and gliosis involving the right temporal lobe. 
There is moderate to advanced cerebral and cerebellar volume loss 
with ex vacuo ventricular prominence.  
 
Old lacunar infarction involving the left basal ganglia.   
Patchy foci of hypoattenuation within the periventricular and

Findings
And noted is a right occipital craniotomy defect. There are operative 
changes consistent with resection of the recurrent neoplasm involving 
the right parietal and occipital lobe 0 along the margins of the 
surgical bed. This was previously noted to be a a glioblastoma. There 
is hemorrhage and or produced few within the surgical bed.  At the 
margins of the resection cavity, there new foci of diffusion 
restriction are horizontal at the inferomedial aspect of the lesion, 
image 13 series 100. The superior aspect of the lesion, image 20 
series 100. These are likely postsurgical in nature.  On the 
postcontrast images, there is are significant improvement in the 
degree of enhancing abnormality. There remains nodular enhancement at 
the margins of the resection cavity favored to represent residual 
neoplasm. There is some T1 hyperintense hemorrhage seen layering at 
the inferior aspect of the resection cavity as on image 86, series 3.  

 
There is again white matter edema extending into the high right 
parietal lobe, the right occipital lobe, the right temporal lobe 
superiorly, and extending across the midline through the splenium of 
the corpus callosum, to involve the left periventricular white matter 
of the parietal lobe.  
 
There is no evidence for hydrocephalus. Midline shift is stable, 
approximately 7.5 mm from right-to-left. There is again effacement of 
the right occipital horn.  
The pituitary gland is normal in size. 
Normal flow void is noted in the major arteries of the circle of

Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were also performed.  
 
Comparison
CT of the head without contrast from 03/07/2014. 
 
Findings
Involutional changes are again noted.  Again noted is a moderate 
hydrocephalus move likely related to normal pressure hydrocephalus 
which has remained unchanged.  There is no transependymal flow of 
CSF.  There is interval development of a focal area of decreased 
attenuation within the far medial aspect of the right parietal lobe 
which may represent evidence of a metastatic lesion given the 
patient's history of lung carcinoma.  An MRI of the brain with 
without contrast is recommended for further evaluation if the patient 
has no contraindications to a.m. brain MRI.  There is no other 
parenchymal abnormality.  There is no midline shift or significant 
mass effect. The calvarium and skull base appear intact.There is no 
significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoids. 
 
Impression
Findings suspicious for a metastatic lesion involving the right 
parietal lobe.  Stable hydrocephalus likely related to normal 
pressure hydrocephalus. The report was faxed to Dr. Santucci's office 
on 01/12/2015.

Comparison
November 4, 2014  
 
Findings
Re- demonstrated are innumerable enhancing lesions in the bilateral 
cerebral hemispheres compatible with metastases. These all appear 
stable or decreased in enhancement compared to the previous study. No 
new lesions are seen. Some of the lesions demonstrate susceptibility 
artifact compatible with remote micro hemorrhage, without change from 
the prior.  
 
Several representative lesions as follows:  
 

     1. Peripherally enhancing left frontal lobe lesion (series 8, 
image 80) has slightly decreased in size in the interim, now 
measuring 1.7 x 1.1 centimeters, previously, measuring 2.0 x 1.3 cm, 
with central /posterior medial cystic degeneration. There is again 
seen an area of restricted diffusion, which is essentially stable 
compared to the prior examination.  The surrounding FLAIR abnormality 
representing vasogenic edema has decreased since the previous study. 
There is mild persistent local mass effect. 
     2. Right frontal lesion (axial image 87) appears minimally 
decreased in size, measuring approximately 9 mm decreased from 12 mm 
on the previous study, previously reported to be enlarging on the 
prior study. Minimal interval decrease in surrounding FLAIR 
abnormality.
     3. Left temporal lesion measures 6 mm, stable from previous 
study. 
     4. High left frontal lesion in the precentral gyrus measures 
approximately 1.1 x 0.5 cm, decreased from 1.7 x 0.7 cm in the 
previous study. 
Additionally noted are FLAIR hyperintense, enhancing lesions in the 
right frontal calvarium measuring approximately 2.1 x 3.1 centimeters 
(AP and CC dimensions) as well as of the left occipital bone (2.0 x 
2.0 centimeters) appear stable from previous study.  
 
The ventricles are stable in size and in configuration. There is mild 
age-related cerebral and cerebellar volume loss.  
 
There is no acute infarction or extra-axial collection.  
 
Evaluation of the paranasal sinuses demonstrate mild mucosal 
thickening in the bilateral frontal, ethmoid and maxillary sinuses 
with a large mucous retention cyst or polyp in the left antrum. There 
remains opacification of the bilateral mastoid air cells.  
The orbits are grossly unremarkable. 
 
 
Impression

     1. Overall findings compatible with treatment response. Decrease 
in surrounding FLAIR hyperintensity involving the cystic/ cavitating 
left frontal lesion which is again noted to demonstrate foci of 
restricted diffusion which are slightly less conspicuous than the 
previous examination, again possibly representative of radiation 
change /necrosis or tumor cellularity. 
     2. Stable enhancing right frontal and left occipital calvarial 
metastases.

Technique
Contiguous axial CT images of the brain were obtained without 
intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were 
obtained.  
 
Contiguous axial CT images of the cervical spine were obtained 
without intravenous contrast. Coronal and sagittal reconstructions 
were obtained.  
 
Comparison
CT brain dated 07/01/2014.  
No prior CT cervical spine available for comparison.  
 
Findings
CT brain:  
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute transcortical 
infarct. There is no mass effect or midline shift.  
 
Generalized loss of volume of the parenchyma with secondary 
prominence of the cortical sulci and ventricles is similar to the 
prior exam. Ventricular system is stable in size and configuration, 
without evidence of hydrocephalus.  
 
There is unchanged encephalomalacia and gliosis in the inferior left 
frontal lobe with secondary ex vacuo enlargement of the left lateral 
ventricle. Redemonstrated is a chronic infarct in the left basal 
ganglia with dystrophic calcifications. Nonspecific intraparenchymal 
calcifications are also redemonstrated in the high left parietal lobe 
and inferior left frontal lobe, overall similar to the prior exam. 
There is also chronic infarct in the superior right frontal lobe 
towards the vertex.  There is confluent low-attenuation within the 
deep white matter and subcortical white matter and patchy areas of 
low attenuation scattered within the ganglial capsular regions, hilum 
or in the brainstem, overall similar to the prior exam, reflecting 
sequela of moderate to severe chronic small vessel ischemia. There 
are extensive vascular calcifications along both internal carotid 
arteries segments, as well as the intracranial vertebral arteries and 
basilar artery.  
 
There is unchanged right suboccipital craniectomy.  No evidence of 
acute depressed skull fracture. The visualized paranasal sinuses and 
mastoid air cells are clear.  
 
CT cervical spine:  
Bones are demineralized, limiting evaluation for nondisplaced 
fractures. Alignment of the cervical spine is maintained.  There is 
mild loss of height of the C4, C5, C6 and C7 vertebral bodies, 
presumably degenerative. There is partial interbody fusion of the C2 
and C3 vertebral fusion of the posterior sets. No evidence of acute 
cervical spine fracture. Anterior and posterior arches of C1 are 
intact. The odontoid is grossly intact. The prevertebral soft tissues 
are not thickened.  
 
There is diffuse cervical spondylosis with posterior facet 
hypertrophy throughout. There is ossification of the posterior 
longitudinal ligament from C2-C4. Evaluation of intraspinal canal 
soft tissues is limited on CT.  If further information regarding disc 
herniation, epidural collection or cord pathology is clinically 
warranted, then MRI should be obtained.  There is prominent partially 
calcified retrosens soft tissue, most likely degenerative ligamentous 
hypertrophy. This results in mild effacement of the canal.  
 
At C3-C4, there is moderate to severe stenosis of the right foramen 
secondary to posterior facet hypertrophy and disc osteophyte complex 
and mild canal stenosis secondary to the ossified posterior 
longitudinal ligament and posterior arch hypertrophy.  
 
At C4-5, there is severe stenosis of the right foramen secondary to 
posterior facet hypertrophy and their is mild canal stenosis 
secondary to central disc osteophyte complex and posterior arch 
hypertrophy.  
 
At C5-6 there is a calcified ligamentum flavum and posterior arch 
hypertrophy with broad disc osteophyte complex resulting in moderate 
canal stenosis.  There is moderate stenosis of both neural foramina, 
left more than right, secondary to posterior facet hypertrophy and 
disc osteophyte complex.  
 
At C6-C7, there is a broad disc osteophyte complex and posterior arch 
hypertrophy resulting in mild to moderate canal stenosis.  There is 
moderate stenosis of the left foramen, predominantly secondary to 
posterior facet hypertrophy and disc osteophyte complex.  
 
At C7-T1, there is moderate stenosis of both foramina secondary to 
posterior facet hypertrophy.  
 
Status post left hemithyroidectomy.  The right lobe of the thyroid 
gland is heterogeneous with punctate calcifications. Consider 
correlation with thyroid sonogram, as clinically warranted. Vascular 
calcifications are present along both carotid bulbs, right more than 
left.  
 
Impression
1. No significant interval change from 07/01/2014. No evidence of 
acute intracranial hemorrhage. Additional findings, as above.  
 
2. No evidence of acute cervical spine fracture.  
 
3. Multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine, as above.

were reviewed in soft tissue, subdural and bone windows. Post 
processing reformatted images were produced and reviewed. 
 
Comparison
None 
 
Findings
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute transcortical infarction. 
There are areas of low attenuation in the periventricular and 
subcortical white matter, a nonspecific finding however most likely 
secondary to chronic small vessel ischemic disease. Evaluation of 
metastatic disease is limited due to lack of intravenous contrast. No 
extra-axial collection or midline shift. Involutional changes are 
noted. No hydrocephalus. The bony calvarium is intact. The native 
lens are not seen, suggestive of prior cataract surgery. The imaged 
portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear 
unremarkable. Intracranial calcified arteriosclerotic vascular 
plaques are present.  
 
Impression

     1. No acute intracranial pathology. 
     2. Limited evaluation for metastatic disease due to lack of 
intravenous contrast; if there is continued clinical concern, 
consider followup MRI with gadolinium if there is no 
contraindication. 
     3. Chronic small vessel ischemic white matter disease.

Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex. 
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
There is hyperdense lesion within the right frontal lobe (series 2, 
image 44) containing coarse linear calcifications, measuring 
approximately 2.4 x 1.4 centimeters, without surrounding edema.  
There is a prominent venous structure descending to it from the 
vertex (series 300, image 37). 
 
There is no CT evidence of acute transcortical infarction or 
extra-axial collection.  There is no mass effect or midline shift.  
 
There is moderate age-related cerebral and cerebellar volume loss 
with ex vacuo ventricular prominence.  
Patchy foci of hypoattenuation within the periventricular and 
subcortical white matter without mass effect are most compatible with 
microvascular ischemic changes given presence of atherosclerotic 
calcifications at the skullbase.  
 
 
The calvarium is intact.  
 
The mastoid air cells are hypo aerated on the right.  There is 
prominent soft tissue thickening involving the right external 
auditory canal, less prominent on the left. There is moderate 
polypoid thickening of the dependently within the maxillary sinuses 
bilaterally.  
 
Impression
Hyperintense, coarsely calcified lesion within the right frontal lobe 
with an adjacent dilated venous structure, likely representing an 
arteriovenous malformation or possibly a cavernoma with an adjacent 
developmental venous anomaly. Further evaluation with MRI and MRA 
recommended. Although hyperdensity within the lesion does not exclude 
the presence of acute blood products, there is no significant 
surrounding edema or associated mass effect.  
There is prominent soft tissue thickening involving the right 
external auditory canal, less prominent on the left. This may 
represent a large amount of cerumen, however correlation with 
physical examination is recommended. 
 
Findings discussed with Dr. Chen of Medicine at 10:40 a.m. on

Contrast
9 cc of Gadavist was administered intravenously.  
 
Comparison
CT of the head without contrast from 01/16/2015. 
 
Findings
There is no area of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction. 
On the postcontrast images there are prominent cortical veins within 
the right frontal region. This is associated with a large 
developmental venous anomaly within the right posterior frontal lobe.  
This leads to focal areas of increased signal intensity on the FLAIR 
sequences with areas of decreased signal intensity on the 
susceptibility weighted images within the right posterior frontal 
lobe which corresponds to the suspected cavernoma within the right 
posterior frontal lobe seen on the prior CT of the head. There is no 
other enhancing abnormality involving the brain parenchyma meninges.  
Involutional changes and chronic microvascular ischemic changes are 
noted. The ventricles and cisterns were unremarkable. There is no 
mass effect or midline shift. There is no evidence of acute 
intracranial hemorrhage.  There is no extra-axial collection. The 
pituitary gland is normal in size. Normal flow void is noted in the 
major arteries of the circle of Willis. There is no significant 
disease in the paranasal sinuses. The orbits are grossly 
unremarkable.

Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
There is a 5 mm hyperdensity within the right frontal lobe, 
consistent with hemorrhagic contusion. There is a minimal amount of 
white matter hypodensity surrounding this region, suggestive of 
vasogenic edema. Alternatively this may represent a small cavernous 
malformation with recent hemorrhage. There is no extra-axial 
collection. 
 
There is no loss of gray-white matter distinction or other sign of 
acute infarction. 
 
The ventricles, cisterns and sulci are age-appropriate in size. 
 
There is no mass effect, midline shift or  focal parenchymal 
abnormality.  
 
The calvarium is intact.  
 
Moderate to severe mucosal thickening is seen within the ethmoid air 
cells and bilateral maxillary sinuses.  
 
Impression
5 mm focus of hyperdensity represent intraparenchymal hemorrhagic 
contusion within the right frontal lobe with mild associated 
vasogenic edema, versus small cavernoma with recent hemorrhage. No 
extra-axial collections. 
 
Moderate to severe mucosal disease as above. 
 
Findings were discussed with Dr. Beinenfeld by Dr. Jacob, radiology

CT head 11/07/2012 
 
Findings
There is a suggestion of a small scalp contusion at the left 
parasagittal vertex without evidence of calvarial fracture or 
intracranial hemorrhage.  
 
There is no CT evidence of acute transcortical infarction, 
intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. No mass effect or 
midline shift.  
Patchy foci of hypoattenuation within the periventricular and 
subcortical white matter without mass effect are most compatible with 
microvascular ischemic changes given presence of atherosclerotic 
calcifications at the skullbase. There are multiple small scattered 
foci of lacunar infarction in the bilateral basal ganglia. There is 
moderate to advanced age-related cerebral and cerebellar volume loss 
with ex vacuo ventricular prominence and prominence of the 
extra-axial spaces over the convexities. There is a stable appearing 
calcified extra-axial subcentimeter density at the right frontal 
paramedian vertex, which may represent a calcification or possibly 
calcified meningioma, with a smaller focus noted at the left frontal 
vertex.  
 
 
There is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses

lesion and no new nonenhancing lesions seen. Lesions are again noted 
in the bilateral cerebral white matter with the largest lesion 
adjacent to the right frontal horn. A lesion is again noted in the 
cerebellar white matter bilaterally. No lesion is noted in the 
brainstem or corpus callosum. 
The ventricles are normal. No significant atrophy of the cerebral 
cortex, cerebellum or corpus callosum is noted.  
There is no mass effect, midline shift or other focal parenchymal 
abnormality.   
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. No

Findings
NECK: LIMITED BY MOTION. FAT SATURATED T1 IMAGES ARE EXTREMELY 
LIMITED IN ASSESSMENT FOR DISSECTION, PARTICULARLY ALONG THE 
VERTEBRAL ARTERIES 
Left vertebral artery is dominant. Unable to assess the V1 segments, 
bilaterally, secondary to technique and motion. Otherwise, no 
significant stenosis of the vertebral arteries, within the neck. 
 
Retropharyngeal CCAs, bilaterally at the level of T1. Right ICA is 
hypoplastic secondary to hypoplastic A1 segment.  There is 
approximately 25 - 30 % stenosis at the origin of the right ICA. 
There is no significant stenosis in the left ICA. 
The right vertebral artery is hypoplastic.  
 
Circle of Willis: LIMITED BY MOTION. 
Anterior circulation:  Hypoplastic right A1. No significant stenosis 
or occlusion in the central arteries. 
 
Posterior circulation:  Fetal origin of both PCAs.   There is severe 
attenuated flow related enhancement of the V4 segment of the 
hypoplastic right vertebral artery which ends in a PICA. There is 
retrograde flow in to the distal tip of the right V4 segment, via the 
PICA. There is flow within a left AICA and bilateral SCAs. There is 
short segment of mild narrowing in the mid basilar artery, after the 
takeoff of the AICA.

The patient's neck is hyperextended. The anterior portion of the mid 
to lower face is outside the field of view. There is abundant streak 
artifact from dental hardware degrading image quality and limiting 
full evaluation. 
 
There is an acute comminuted fracture of the lateral wall of the 
right maxillary sinus with punctate foci of air and high-density 
fluid within the right maxillary sinus. There is a partially 
visualized comminuted and depressed fracture of the right zygomatic 
arch.  There is a mildly displaced fracture of the right lateral 
orbital wall. There is a mild sutural diastasis involving the right 
zygomaticofrontal suture.  
 
There is no obvious acute transcortical infarction. There is no gross 
intracranial hemorrhage or large extra-axial collection given 
limitation of the study. There is no mass effect or midline shift. 
There is periventricular and subcortical hypodensity related to 
chronic microvascular ischemic changes.

Findings
 
CT perfusion: Perfusion images are suboptimal secondary to technique. 
There is however no evidence of gross asymmetry. Correlation with MRI 
is offered if there is continued clinical concern for infarct.  
 
CT angio of the neck: The vertebral arteries are codominant and 
developmentally small in size. Difficult to assess the origin of the 
vertebral arteries due to extensive streak artifact from the 
patient's left chest pacemaker. Otherwise, there is no evidence of 
greater than 30 percent stenosis or occlusion of the carotid or 
vertebral arteries, within the neck.  
 
CT angiography of the head: There is no evidence of occlusion or 
significant stenosis in the circle of Willis. There is fetal origin 
of bilateral posterior cerebral arteries with prominent posterior 
communicating arteries. There is associated diminutive 
vertebrobasilar system.  
 
Impression
CT angio of the neck: No significant stenosis of the carotid or 
vertebral arteries, within the neck. 
 
CT angiography of the head: No significant stenosis in the circle of 
Willis.

Multiple sclerosis.  
 
Additional History
Multiple sclerosis.  
 
Technique
A multisequential, multiplanar MRI of the brain was performed prior 
to and following intravenous administration of 8.8 mL of Gadavist 
contrast. 
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent GADAVIST 8.8 milliliters 01/16/2015 INTRAVENOUS 
 
Comparison
MRI brain dated 12/17/2005  
 
Findings
There is no area of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction.  

Again demonstrated are multiple periventricular and juxtacortical 
white matter lesions, consistent with demyelinating plaques in this 
patient with the provided history of multiple sclerosis. Allowing for 
technical differences, there are multiple new white matter lesions 
since the previous exam. For example there is a new periventricular 
right temporal lesion, 3 new lesions in the right frontal lobe, 
juxtacortical anterior left frontal lesion, juxtacortical high left 
frontal lobe, periventricular white matter in the left temporal lobe. 
Noted these lesions demonstrate enhancement or restricted diffusion 
to suggest active demyelination.  
The ventricles are normal. 
There is no mass effect, midline shift or hydrocephalus.   
There are no enhancing mass lesions in the parenchyma. No abnormal 
contrast intracranial enhancement noted. 
The sella turcica is unremarkable in  
The flow voids of the major arteries in the circle of Willis and 
major dural sinuses are present.  
There is no significant disease in the paranasal sinuses. 
The visualized intraorbital contents are grossly unremarkable.

Multiple new white matter lesions since the 12/17/2005 MRI, as 
described above, compatible with progression of demyelinating plaques 
given the provided history of multiple sclerosis.  No restricted 
diffusion or enhancement of these white matter lesions to suggest 
active demyelination.

Findings
This study is limited secondary to motion artifact with streak 
artifact in the posterior fossa. There is hyperdensity involving the 
basilar artery likely representing thrombus.  There are areas of 
hypoattenuation within the pons and midbrain consistent with the 
patient's known history of acute infarct. There is mild mass effect 
in this region.  There is no midline shift. There is no large 
extra-axial hemorrhage.  There is no intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  
There is limited evaluation for subtle areas of subarachnoid 
hemorrhage secondary to motion artifact. There are involutional 
changes without hydrocephalus.  There is small vessel disease.  There 
are multiple vascular calcifications.  The basal cisterns are patent.  
There is no acute calvarial fracture.  
 
There is moderate mucosal thickening within the left ethmoid sinus.  
There is a small amount of fluid layering within both sphenoid 
sinuses, the left maxillary sinus, and the left ethmoid sinus. There 
is no significant mastoid air cell disease.  
 
Impression
Limited study with motion artifact and streak artifact in the 
posterior fossa. Acute infarct involving the brainstem including the 
pons and midbrain with associated mass effect.  No midline shift.  No 
large intraparenchymal or extra-axial hemorrhage. Limited evaluation 
for subtle subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex. 
 
Comparison
CT head without contrast on 12/08/2014 
 
Findings
Motion results in severe streak artifact and significant image 
degradation, markedly limiting evaluation.  
 
 
Re-identified is known hypoattenuation within the pons and midbrain 
compatible with evolving infarction. There is mild associated mass 
effect, however the basal cisterns remain grossly patent. The 
previously visualized hyperdensity within the basilar artery has 
largely resolved. There is no obvious hemorrhagic conversion given 
marked limitations of the study. There is no obvious extra-axial 
collection.  
 
Patchy foci of hypoattenuation within the periventricular and 
subcortical white matter without mass effect are most compatible with 
microvascular ischemic changes given presence of atherosclerotic 
calcifications at the skullbase. Ventricles are unchanged in size and 
configuration compared to prior examination.  
 
 
 
The calvarium is intact.  
There is mild mucosal thickening within the left ethmoid air cells, 
both sphenoid sinuses as well as the left maxillary sinus. The 
mastoid air cells are clear. The visualized orbits are unremarkable.  
 
Impression
Markedly limited examination. Known infarct involving the brainstem 
without obvious hemorrhagic conversion or significant change from the 
prior examination.

Findings
 
There is increased density along the bilateral cerebral convexities 
of both frontal and temporal lobes concerning for a bilateral 
subarachnoid hemorrhage although the study is somewhat technically 
limited due to artifact and the possibility of streaky from the 
calvarium is not excluded.  There is also an increased from 
peripheral density in in the bilateral posterior cerebellum favored 
to represent streak artifact from the skullbase although extensive 
subarachnoid hemorrhage to the posterior fossa is not excluded. 
 
There is prominence of the ventricles and sulci representing 
age-related involutional changes. Decreased attenuation of the 
periventricular white matter likely represents chronic ischemic 
microvascular white matter disease. Subparagraph there is no mass 
effect or midline shift.  
 
The calvarium is intact.  
 
There is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses

Impression
Bilateral cortical hyperdensity along the cerebral convexities of the 
bilateral frontal and temporal lobes concerning for subarachnoid 
hemorrhage with possible extension into the posterior fossa. In this 
patient without a history of recent trauma, consider possibility of a 
ruptured aneurysm and recommend CT angiography. Also would consider 
followup head CT in 6-12 hours to exclude artifact and 
confirm/revaluate hemorrhage.

There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. No 
abnormal contrast enhancement is noted in the brain or leptomeninges. 
 
There is postsurgical changes related to prior transsphenoidal 
surgery. There is a thin rim of enhancing tissue seen at the left 
lower anterior aspect of the sella turcica, where the pituitary stalk 
is displaced anteriorly. The sella turcica as well is again noted to 
be mildly expanded by FLAIR isointense, T2 hyperintense lesion, 
measuring approximately 1.7 x 1.1 x 1.2 centimeters in transverse, CC 
and AP dimension, which contacts the inferior aspect of the optic 
chiasm without causing significant superior bowing. The pituitary 
infundibulum remains slightly displaced to the left of midline.  
 
There is mild scattered mucosal thickening throughout the paranasal 
sinuses. Mastoid air cells are clear.  
The orbits are grossly unremarkable. 
 
Impression
Postoperative changes of transsphenoidal resection without 
significant interval change in appearance of the sella and 
suprasellar region, as above.

2 mm left anterior frontal and 3 mm posterior frontal lobe juxta 
cortical lesions (series 100 image 97), a 3 mm nodule posterior right 
frontal lobe juxta cortical lesion (series 102 image 90), 4 mm medial 
left frontal lobe juxta cortical lesion (series 102 image 96), 3 mm 
in paraplegic right temporal parietal lesion (series 100 image 83), 
and a 4 mm right parietal juxta cortical lesion (series 107). A few 
punctate T2 hyperintense foci are seen in the left inferior 
cerebellar peduncle and in the visualized cervical spinal cord.  
 
Ventricles, cisterns and sulci are age appropriate in size.  
 
There is no mass, mass effect, or midline shift.  
 
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection.  
 
No abnormal contrast enhancement is seen within the brain or the 
leptomeninges.  
 
There is normal flow voids in the major arteries of the circle of 
Willis.  
 
The pituitary gland is normal in size.  
 
There is no significant disease in the paranasal sinuses.  
 
No gross abnormality is noted within the orbits.  
 
Impression

     1. No abnormal diffusion restriction to suggest acute 
infarction. 
     2. Scattered nonenhancing supratentorial FLAIR/T2 white matter 
hyperintensities in the juxta cortical and periventricular 
distributions as well as in the cervical spinal cord. Differential 
diagnosis is wide but should include multiple sclerosis. Correlate 
with history, lab and neurological examination.

Technique
CT perfusion: Before and during a contrast bolus injection, multiple 
5mm thick stacks of perfusion data were collected   .Following this, 
workstation technology was employed to create time of arrival, blood 
flow, mean transit time and blood volume color perfusion maps. 
 
CT angio of the neck: Following rapid IV bolus of contrast material, 
rapid helical imaging with very thin slices from the aortic arch to 
the lower cranial level was performed. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was utilized to create 3-D rendered MIP images.  NASCET 
methodology was employed to evaluate the degree of stenosis. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Following rapid injection of intravenous 
contrast material after an appropriate delay, very thin helical axial 
slices were obtained through the entire head. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was employed to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
 
Contrast
135 mL of Omnipaque 350 was administered intravenously on 01/24/2015.  

 
Comparison
No prior CTs are available for direct comparison.  Noncontrast 
enhanced head CT from 01/24/2015 01:08 a.m. was reviewed.  
 
Findings
CT perfusion: No area of significant asymmetrical perfusion is 
detected. 
 
CT angio of the neck: There is no evidence of hemodynamically 
significant stenosis or occlusion of the right or left carotid and 
vertebral arteries. Note that streak artifact obscures the proximal 
great vessels as well as the origins of the vertebral arteries.  
 
CT angiography of the head: There is no evidence of vascular 
occlusive disease, definite aneurysm or AVM. .

Clinical History
Left-sided weakness.  Neurologic deficit.  
 
 
History and Indication
LEFT SIDED WEAKNESS 
 
 
Technique
A multisequential, multiplanar MRI of the brain was performed without 
intravenous contrast.  
 
Comparison
No prior MRI brain available for comparison.  
 
Correlation is made with the head CT dated 01/24/2015  
 
Findings
This exam is somewhat limited by motion on several sequences.  
 
There is no restricted diffusion within the parenchyma to indicate an 
acute infarction.  
 
There is no mass effect, midline shift or hydrocephalus.  
 
There are multiple punctate foci of hyperintense T2/FLAIR signal 
scattered within the deep and subcortical white matter of the frontal 
and parietal lobes, as well as in the left temporal lobe. There is 
also a punctate focus of hyperintense T2/FLAIR signal in the left 
middle cerebellar peduncle.  There is a focal chronic lacune within 
the right parietal deep white matter.  
 
The flow voids of the major arteries and the circle of Willis are 
present. There is no tonsillar herniation. The sella turcica is 
unremarkable. 
 
There are no fluid levels in the visualized paranasal sinuses or 
mastoid air cells.  There is mild mucosal thickening along the 
maxillary sinuses.  There is a right concha bullosa.  There is a T2 
hyperintense Thornwaldt cyst, in the midline nasopharynx, measuring 
0.8 x 0.7 x 1.0 cm. Heterogeneously hyperintense T1 signal within 
this cyst is likely secondary to proteinaceous contents.  
 
Impression
No evidence of acute infarction. No mass effect, midline shift or 
hydrocephalus.  
 
Multiple punctate foci of hyperintense T2/FLAIR signal scattered 
within the deep and subcortical white matter, as above. These are 
nonspecific and may be attributed to mild chronic small vessel 
ischemia, migraine headaches, vasculitis, infectious/inflammatory 
processes and less likely demyelination. Correlate clinically.

Comparison
No prior CT imaging of the head is available for direct comparison.   
CT of the neck from 01/12/2015 was reviewed.  
 
Findings
There is no loss of gray-white matter distinction or other sign of 
acute transcortical infarction. 
 
Involutional changes.  
 
There is no mass effect, midline shift or  focal parenchymal 
abnormality.  
 
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. 
 
The calvarium is intact. The visualized osseous structures are 
diffusely demineralized with a mottled appearance and areas of 
cortical erosion. Additionally there is diffuse thicening of the 
calvarium. Findings may be related to patient's thalassemia.  
 
Complete opacification of the right nasal passage, right ethmoid 
sinus, bilateral frontal sinus, and right maxillary sinus is again 
noted with heterogeneous areas of hyperattenuation. Widening of the 
right maxillary ostium is again noted without significant interval 
change. There is marked thinning of the posterior wall of the right 
frontal sinus with apparent erosion of the inner table (images 28 and 
29, series 2). There is erosion of the right frontal sinus inferiorly 
into the superior aspect of the right orbit (image 17, series 2). 
Along the medial wall of the right orbit, there is erosion of the 
right lacrimal bone and orbital process of the maxilla with marked 
thinning and abnormal lateral bowing of the lamina proprecia. There 
is erosion of the medial right maxillary sinus wall with soft tissue 
protruding into the nasopharynx. There is opacification of the 
mastoid air cells and middle ear, right greater than left.  Cerumen 
is seen in the external auditory canals bilaterally.  
 
Interval placement of catheter tubing in the left nasopharynx, only 
partially imaged. 
 
 
Impression

     1. No evidence of acute territorial infarction or intracranial 
hemorrhage. Findings comminuted to Dr. Mirchandani by Dr. Yoon at 
8:50 p.m. on 01/13/2015.
     2. Right paranasal sinus mass like opacification with areas 
hyperdensity and associated foci of bony erosion as detailed above. 
Diagnostic considerations again include but are not limited to mass 
with hemorrhage, inspissated secretions, and/or fungal infection. 
These findings were previously seen and described on CT of the neck 
from 01/12/2015. ENT consultation is advised.
     3. Diffused thickening and mottled appearance of the calvaria 
likely reflecting extramedullary hematopoiesis in this patient with a 
given history of thalassemia.

Clinical History
Neurologic deficit. Possible CVA.  Possible stroke.  
 
 
History and Indication
POSS CVA 
 
 
Technique
A limited MRI of the brain was performed using axial 
diffusion-weighted sequence and axial FLAIR sequence, as per the 
ordering physician's request, to evaluate for acute infarction.  
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
There is no restricted diffusion in the parenchyma to suggest an 
acute infarction. There is no mass effect, midline shift or 
hydrocephalus. No focal extra-axial collection. There are few 
punctate foci of FLAIR signal scattered within the deep and 
subcortical white matter of the frontal lobes.  These are nonspecific 
and have been reported in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, 
but may be the sequela of very mild chronic small vessel ischemia.  
 
There is opacification of the mastoid air cells, right more than 
left. There is diffuse opacification of both frontal sinuses, right 
maxillary and ethmoid air cells within in similar-appearing signal 
extending into the right nasal cavity. This is better assessed on 
recent CT. ENT evaluation is recommended.  
 
Impression
No acute infarct. No mass effect, midline shift or hydrocephalus.  
 
Diffuse opacification of the right sinonasal cavity, which is seen to 
better advantage on the recent CT head. ENT evaluation is suggested.

Technique
Multiple sequences were performed through the brain in multiple 
planes.  
 
Comparison
Prior MRI of the brain from 06/20/2012 and 10/18/2011  
 
Findings
 There is no evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest acute 
infarction.  
Again there is focal parenchymal volume loss with gliotic changes 
involving the inferior bifrontal lobes which is associated with 
hemosiderin staining on the susceptibility weighted images ; overall 
appearance is compatible with prior contusions. This is stable to the 
prior study.  
There are multiple white matter FLAIR hyperintensities which may 
represent small vessel disease.  
On the SWI sequence, there are multiple parenchymal foci of 
susceptibility with some gyral hemosiderin seen in the high 
frontoparietal lobes. These findings are compatible with prior 
multiple hemorrhages including subarachnoid hemorrhage.  
Ventricles, cisterns and sulci are age appropriate in size.  
There is a subtle dural-based mass seen arising from the planum 
sphenoidale, measuring 2.1 x 2.00 x 1.3 cm (AP x TR x CC), slightly 
increased in size from prior study, most likely representing a 
meningioma. This exerts slight mass effect upon the inferior frontal 
lobes.  
There is no extra-axial collection.  
There is normal flow voids in the major arteries of the circle of 
Willis.  
The pituitary gland is normal in size.  
There is no significant disease in the paranasal sinuses.  
No gross abnormality is noted within the orbits.  
 
Impression

Findings
Please note, evaluation is subject to motion degradation, decreasing 
sensitivity for subtle abnormalities especially at the skullbase.  
 
There is no loss of gray-white matter distinction or other sign of 
acute infarction. Patchy subcortical and periventricular 
hypodensities are consistent with relatively advanced small vessel 
disease. Chronic bilateral basal ganglia lacunar infarcts are 
unchanged.  
The ventricles, cisterns and sulci are age-appropriate in size, 
representing advanced involutional changes. 
There is no mass effect or midline shift.  
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. 
Atherosclerotic calcification of the bilateral carotid siphons is 
noted.  
 
The calvarium is intact. Small left frontoparietal scalp hematoma is 
noted.  
 
New complete opacification of the left sphenoid sinus is noted, in 
addition to moderate mucosal thickening within the anterior ethmoid 
and right sphenoid sinuses. Mucous retention cyst versus polyps are 
suggested in the partially visualized bilateral maxillary sinuses.  
 
 
Impression
Small left frontoparietal scalp hematoma, without evidence of 
underlying acute calvarial injury.  No acute intracranial hemorrhage.

There is no significant interval change in the left-sided zygomatic 
hematoma and scalp hematoma along the left frontal temporal lobe. 
Adjacent radiopaque foreign bodies are again identified.  
 
There has been no significant change in the size of the ventricles. 
The ventricular system appears small in caliber. A right frontal 
approach pressure monitor is identified, with tip within the right 
frontal parenchyma. The sulci and basal cisterns are small in caliber 
and edema cannot be entirely excluded. There is a questionable small 
amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage outlining the circle Willis.

regions. There is minimal mass effect upon the underlying brain 
parenchyma. These are better seen on the current study since there 
has been further resolution of the previously noted pneumocephalus. 
There is a possible new focus of hemorrhage within the cerebral 
aqueduct (see image 20, series 2). There is a small amount of 
subarachnoid hemorrhage within the interpeduncular cistern. There is 
a pressure monitoring device within the right frontal lobe. There is 
no hydrocephalus. There is partial effacement of the basal cisterns 
as well as multiple sulci.  There is slight blurring of the gray/ 
white matter differentiation. There is no midline shift.  
 
Again seen is soft tissue swelling with associated hematoma and 
likely subcentimeter radiopaque foreign bodies involving the left 
face. Again seen are partially visualized facial bone fractures.  
There is resultant partial opacification of the paranasal sinuses.  
 
Impression
1. Stable areas of intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the left 
frontal lobe.  
2. Questionable foci of hemorrhage within both parietal and both 
temporal regions.  
3. Small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage.  
4. Small focus of intraventricular hemorrhage which is new.  
5. Resolving pneumocephalus with a small amount of residual noted 
revealing small mixed density subdural collections within both 
frontal regions.  
6. Diffuse sulcal effacement and partial effacement of the basal 
cisterns with blurring of the gray/ white matter differentiation 
concerning for cerebral edema.

Evaluation is limited due to streak artifact from dental hardware and 
endotracheal tube.  
 
Noncontrast CT head: There is no loss of gray-white matter 
distinction or other sign of acute infarction. There is no 
significant interval change in the areas of intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage within left frontal lobe. There has been a decrease in 
small amount pneumocephalus. Unchanged heterogeneous hypodense 
collections within the bilateral frontal regions causing minimal mass 
effect upon the underlying brain parenchyma. There is unchanged small

Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex. 
 
Comparison
CT head from 12/08/2014  
 
Findings
Motion results in streak artifact and significant image degradation, 
markedly limiting evaluation.  
Redemonstrated is a resolving extracranial soft tissue injury/ scalp 
hematoma, most prominent over the left parietal region. A right 
frontal approach intracranial pressure monitor remains in place. 
There has been interval resolution of pneumocephalus. There are small 
scattered foci of intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the left frontal 
lobe, which are not significantly changed appearance from prior study 
; there is mild associated surrounding hypoattenuation/edema. 
Scattered foci of intraparenchymal and lower subarachnoid hemorrhage 
within the bilateral temporoparietal regions are suspected.  
 
 
 
Again seen are foci of intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the left 
frontal lobe which are grossly stable in size.  Some of the areas of 
hemorrhage demonstrate surrounding vasogenic edema with localized 
mass effect. There may be scattered areas of intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage within both temporal and both parietal regions. There is a 
small amount of pneumocephalus which is decreased in amount when 
compared with the prior study. Redemonstrated are minimal 
predominantly hypodense then extra-axial collections over the 
bilateral frontal convexities, which are unchanged from the prior 
study.  
 
There remains partial effacement of the basal cisterns and sulci 
diffusely, concerning for cerebral edema.  The ventricles appear 
diminished in size and slit-like. 3rd ventricle is not well seen. 
There is no midline shift. There is no tonsillar herniation. Given 
limitations of the study, there is no definite CT evidence of acute 
transcortical infarction.  
 
Redemonstrated are partially visualized facial bone fractures with 
resultant partial opacification of the paranasal sinuses. The mastoid 
air cells are clear.  
 
 
Impression
1. Limited examination. Diffuse sulcal effacement and partial

large intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Evaluation for acute infarction is 
markedly limited, but no large lobar transcortical infarct is noted.  
 
The ventricles and sulci are unchanged in size and configuration. 
There is no definite midline shift.  The basal cisterns appear 
patent.  There is no tonsillar herniation.  
 
There are thin bifrontal several hypodense extra-axial collections, 
better evaluated on the prior examination. Redemonstrated is minimal

Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the

Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
This examination is extremely limited by motion and streak artifact. 
Within these limitations, there is no evidence of acute territorial 
infarct or acute intracranial hemorrhage.  
 
There is no mass effect or midline shift.  
 
There is persistent moderate enlargement of the lateral and 3rd 
ventricles, slightly increased from the previous exam, with a normal 
caliber 4th ventricle.  These findings are compatible with 
hydrocephalus, which may be attributed to aqueductal stenosis and /or 
NPH.  
 
 Redemonstrated is areas of encephalomalacia and gliosis in the 
inferior left frontal lobe. Additionally, there are confluent areas 
of low attenuation in the corona radiata and centrum semiovale, which 
are nonspecific, but may reflect the sequelae of small vessel 
ischemia.  There is no low-attenuation in the periventricular white 
matter, which may represent some combination of small vessel ischemia 
with transependymal flow of CSF.  
 
The calvarium is intact.  
 
There is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses 
and mastoids. 
 
Impression

     1. Exam is limited by motion. No evidence of acute intracranial 
hemorrhage or skull fracture. 
     2. Persistent moderate enlargement of the lateral and 3rd 
ventricles, mildly increased from the previous exam, with a normal 
caliber 4th ventricle.  These findings are compatible with 
hydrocephalus, which may be either due to aqueductal stenosis or NPH.  
Correlate clinically. MRI with sagittal CISS sequence may be useful 
in assessing the patency of the aqueduct. Low-attenuation in the 
periventricular white matter may represent transependymal flow of 
CSF.

There is a implant as well circumscribed soft tissue density within 
the left internal auditory canal suspicious for an acoustic neuroma.  
This measures approximately 6.1 x 3.8 mm in size. A dedicated MRI of 
the IACs without IV contrast is recommended for further evaluation. 
The bilateral cerebellopontine angles and the right internal auditory 
canal appeared grossly unremarkable.  There is no gross abnormality 
involving the bilateral inner ear structures. 
 
 
Mild involutional changes are noted.  The ventricles and cisterns 
were unremarkable. There is a nonspecific white matter hyperintensity 
within the right posterior frontal lobe best demonstrated on plain 
axial image 43.  There is no other parenchymal abnormality.  There is 
no mass effect or midline shift.  
 
 
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection.  
 
There is normal flow voids in the major arteries of the circle of

Technique
3D time-of-flight for the arteries in the head and neck. Following 
this MIP images were created. NASCET methodology was employed to 
evaluate the degree of stenosis. 
 
Comparison
Correlation is made to CTA of the head from 12/31/2014  
 
Findings
Motion results in streak artifact and significant image degradation, 
limiting evaluation.  
Within the neck, there is no definite evidence of hemodynamically 
significant stenosis of the cervical carotid and vertebral arteries. 
The origins of the vertebral arteries and great vessels as well as 
their proximal segments are poorly evaluated.  
Within the head, there is no hemodynamically significant stenosis, 
definite aneurysm or vascular malformation.  There is a minimal 1mm 
focal outpouching at the origin of the hypoplastic right posterior 
communicating artery which likely represents an infundibulum. The 
right A1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery is slightly 
hypoplastic. There is artifact producing irregularity of the M1 and 
M2 middle cerebral artery vessels on the right, not visualized on the 
prior CTA.

History and Indication
History of astrocytoma. Status post VP SHUNT. Altered mental status 
and hypothermia.  
 
 
Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex without intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal 
reconstructions were obtained. . 
 
Comparison
CT of the head dated 12/18/2014.   
 
Correlation is made with the MRI of the brain dated 12/20/2014.  
 
Findings
There is no loss of gray-white matter distinction or other sign of 
acute territorial infarction.  
 
Left posterior parietal approach VP shunt is again noted coursing 
through a decompressed left lateral ventricle. Low-attenuation along 
the catheter tract is similar to the prior exam, representing 
gliosis. The tip of the catheter is similar in position to the prior 
exam, possibly terminating within the parenchyma just cephalad to the 
left frontal horn. Ventricular system is stable in size and 
configuration. There is no evidence of developing hydrocephalus. The 
extracranial portions of this left parietal approach ventricular 
shunt catheter appear contiguous without kinking or surrounding fluid 
collections.  
 
There is also a residual catheter remaining in the soft tissues 
overlying posterior right parietal and temporal bones, extending 
inferiorly in the posterior right neck soft tissues.  
 
The patient is status post bifrontal craniectomy with cranioplasty. 
Underlying thickening and calcification of the dura is again noted, 
similar to the prior exam, likely postsurgical change. There is 
extensive areas of encephalomalacia and gliosis in the inferior 
frontal lobes, left more than right, similar to the prior exam. Again 
redemonstrated is a grossly stable heterogenous mass lesion with 
peripheral calcifications, centered in the hypothalamic region and 
suprasellar cistern, corresponding to the patient's known 
astrocytoma. There are also areas of encephalomalacia and gliosis in 
the left parietal lobe and right frontal lobes, likely along a prior 
ventricular shunt catheter tract.  
 
There is no definite evidence of acute transcortical infarction or 
acute intracranial hemorrhage. There is no midline shift.  
 
There is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses 
or mastoid air cells.  
 
Impression

     1. No significant interval change from 12/18/2014. No evidence 
of acute territorial infarction or acute intracranial hemorrhage. 
     2. Stable appearance of a left parietal approach VP shunt 
catheter with no significant change in size of the ventricular 
system.  No evidence of developing hydrocephalus. 
     3. Grossly stable heterogenous mass in the hypothalamic region 
in suprasellar cistern, consistent with known astrocytoma. 
     4. Additional extensive postsurgical changes with 
encephalomalacia and gliosis, as described above.  These are similar 
to the prior exam.

CT HEAD ROUTINE WITHOUT CONTRAST  
 
Clinical History
History rectal carcinoma.  
 
 
History and Indication
51-year-old male with acute mental status changes and lethargy.  
 
 
Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were also performed.  
 
Comparison
MRI of the brain from 10/10/2014 
 
Findings
There is no loss of gray-white matter distinction or other sign of 
acute infarction. 
 
The ventricles, cisterns and sulci are age-appropriate in size. 
 
There is no mass effect, midline shift or other focal parenchymal 
abnormality.  
 
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. 
 
There is a large expansile lytic lesion compatible with metastases 
involving the left parieto-occipital skull. Given differences in 
modality this is remained stable in comparison to study  
 
There is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses 
and mastoids. 
 
Impression
Large expansile metastatic lesion within parieto-occipital skull. No 
focal parenchymal abnormality.  No intracranial hemorrhage. There is 
no gross evidence of an acute infarction, however, acute infarction 
may not always be radiographically evident on non contrast head CT 
within the 1st 12-24 hrs.  There remains a strong clinical suspicion 
of acute infarction then an MRI of the brain or a followup head CT in 
24 hr is recommended.

Findings
Again noted is a metastatic lesion involving the left parietal 
calvarium near the vertex. This lesion is decreased in size in 
comparison to previous study. The calvarium is otherwise unremarkable 
as is the skullbase. There is no abnormal enhancement involving the 
brain parenchyma or leptomeninges. There is a punctate focus of 
restricted diffusion involving the left posterior frontal lobe white 
matter near the vertex best demonstrated on FLAIR axial image 130 and 
on image 24 on series 101) to be 1000 series). This is compatible 
with an acute infarction.  There is no other focus of restricted 
diffusion. There is no perfusion abnormality. The ventricles are 
normal. There is no mass effect or midline shift.  Involutional 
changes are noted.  The ventricles and cisterns are unremarkable.  
There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. There is a mild 
diffuse thickened enhancing dura likely reactive in nature probably 
related to the large metastatic lesion involving the left parietal 
calvarium.  There is no evidence to suggest dural based metastasis.  
 
Impression
Interval decrease in the size of the mass that lesion involving the 
left parietal calvarium. Thickened enhancing dura likely reactive in 
nature.  Punctate focus of restricted diffusion compatible with acute 
infarction involving the left posterior frontal lobe white matter.

enhancing extra-axial mass lesions.  There is no abnormal 
intracranial enhancement.  
 
There are few punctate foci of T2/FLAIR signal within the white 
matter of the frontal lobes, right parietal lobe and cerebellum. 
These are nonspecific and not associated with mass effect.  These 
have been described in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and 
may be the sequela of very mild chronic small vessel ischemia.  
 
There are mild generalized age related involutional changes with 
secondary prominence of the cortical sulci and ventricles.  There is 
no significant mass effect.  There is no midline shift or 
hydrocephalus.  
 
There is no tonsillar herniation. There is a partially empty sella 
turcica. The flow voids in the central arteries of the circle of 
Willis are present. The intradural vertebral arteries both abut and 
mildly indent the lateral aspects of the pontomedullary junction, 
with no signal abnormality in the parenchyma.  
 
There is mild mucosal thickening along the inferior left frontal 
sinus and bilateral anterior ethmoid air cells. The visualized 
intraorbital contents are unremarkable. 
 
Impression
No evidence of acute infarct or space occupying mass lesion. No 
abnormal intracranial enhancement. No hydrocephalus.

Findings
There is no area of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction.  

 
Again noted are bilateral parietal approach ventricular shunt 
catheters with metallic susceptibility artifact limiting evaluation, 
the catheter tips are unchanged in position. The ventricles remain 
small, unchanged from prior study. There is evidence of left sided 
craniotomy with susceptibility artifact limiting evaluation.  
 
Again seen is a suprasellar mass compatible with patient's known

x 3.5 x 3.8 cm (oblique AP x oblique CC x TRV) (measured on image 58, 
series 701 and image 94, series 7). It is unchanged in size compared 
to prior when remeasured using similar technique. It demonstrates 
heterogeneous in signal with areas of marked FLAIR hyperintensity 
interspersed with areas of isointensity to gray matter. The lesion is 
hypointense on T1 weighted sequences and demonstrates heterogeneous 
enhancement postcontrast. The lesion extends to the bilateral sylvian 
fissures laterally and posteriorly to the interpeduncular cistern, 
unchanged. The tumor continues to elevate the floor of the 3rd 
ventricle and obscures the optic chiasm. A normal pituitary gland is 
identified inferior to the lesion.

There is no area of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction.  

There is no interval change in the extent of demyelinating disease 
present. There are no enhancing white matter lesions and no new 
nonenhancing white matter lesions noted. 
Again seen are metastases to the deep scalp, calvarium and epidural 
space. Prominent involvement of the right parietal bone with epidural 
extension is seen. Lesions are again noted in the right frontal bone, 
left parietal bone and occiput. There is metastasis to the pterion 
and right sphenoid bone with epidural extension and extension into 
the lateral right orbit where the orbital component appears to 
involve the right lacrimal gland and extends posterior to it along 
the lateral orbital wall. Relatively thick epidural extension is 
noted posterior to the right greater sphenoid wing. Prominent 
retrocerebellar metastasis is noted to the left of center. All of 
these lesions are larger than on the prior study. There is an 
enhancing subcutaneous metastasis in the left suboccipital scalp 
which was present on the prior study. Prominent scalp involvement is 
noted over the right frontal convexity. 
Tumor is again seen in the infratemporal fossa on either side of the 
mandibular ramus displacing the master muscle laterally and the 
lateral pterygoid muscle medially. The mandible is still visualized 
within this tumor. CT would be required to determine the extent of 
involvement of the bony right mandible. This area of tumor is larger

CT HEAD ROUTINE WITHOUT CONTRAST  
 
Clinical History
Subarachnoid hemorrhage.  
 
 
History and Indication
Status post coiling aneurysm.  Followup.  
 
 
Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex without intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal 
reconstructions were obtained.  
 
Comparison
Head CT dated 12/19/2014.  
 
Findings
There has interval coil mass in the region of the anterior 
communicating artery.  There is streak artifact from the coil mass, 
which limits evaluation of the parenchyma in this region. There is 
persistent subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basal cisterns, 
predominantly within the suprasellar and paramesencephalic cisterns.  
The subarachnoid hemorrhage appears less dense than on the prior 
exam.  There is mild hemorrhage layering in the occipital horn of the 
left lateral ventricle and within the 4th ventricle. There is slight 
interval enlargement of the lateral, 3rd and 4th ventricles. There is 
no evidence of acute territorial infarct. There is no mass effect or 
midline shift. There is persistent effacement of the cortical sulci, 
representing swelling. There is unchanged nonspecified low 
attenuation in the white matter directly adjacent to the frontal horn 
of the right lateral ventricle.  This may be the sequela of chronic 
small vessel ischemia.  There are vascular calcifications in both 
internal carotid artery siphons.  
 
The calvarium is intact. There is no significant disease in the 
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoids. There is a right concha 
bullosa. There is a 3.3 x 4.5 cystic mass in the right suboccipital 
region, possibly a sebaceous cyst. Please correlate clinically with 
physical exam and history.  
 
Impression
Status post coiling of aneurysm with evolving subarachnoid 
hemorrhage.  Unchanged intraventricular hemorrhage.  Mild interval 
enlargement of the lateral, 3rd and 4th ventricles, representing mild 
hydrocephalus.

There is no evidence of vascular occlusive disease, AVM, or aneurysm 
of the intracranial arteries involving the circle of Willis. There is 
persistent fetal origin of the left posterior cerebral artery which 
is an anatomical variation.  
 
Impression

     1. Suggestion of congenital hypoplasia of the left vertebral 
artery without definitive abrupt change in caliber to suggest 
occlusion. Normal bilateral internal carotid arteries and the right 
vertebral artery within the neck. 
     2. No evidence of an aneurysm, AVM or vascular occlusive disease 
involving the arteries of the circle Willis.

Contrast
Contrast Agent GADAVIST 10 milliliters 01/07/2015 INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
There are multiple,  bilateral foci of restricted diffusion within 
the cerebral and the cerebellar hemispheres, the largest of these 
involves the posterior right frontal lobe and insular cortex 
corresponding to the acute infarct seen on CT. Additional 
subcentimeter foci are seen within the gray white matter interface of 
the bilateral parietal and occipital lobes as well as within the 
bilateral cerebellar hemispheres, likely secondary to multiple 
embolic infarctions. There is associated T2/FLAIR hyperintensity 
without enhancement of these regions suggesting that they are acute 
to early subacute infarcts.  
 
The ventricles are normal. 
There is no mass effect or midline shift.   
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. No 
abnormal contrast enhancement is noted in the brain or leptomeninges. 
The pituitary gland is normal in size. 
Normal flow void is noted in the major arteries of the circle of 
Willis.  
There is no significant disease in the paranasal sinuses. 
The orbits are grossly unremarkable. 
 
Impression
Restricted diffusion with enhancement and FLAIR pattern consistent 
with acute to early subacute infarct involving the right frontal and 
temporal lobes, corresponding to the infarct seen on CT head.  
Multiple additional subcentimeter foci restricted diffusion at the 
gray-white matter interface of the bilateral cerebral hemispheres and 
within the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres highly suggestive of 
multiple embolic infarctions.

History and Indication
Spontaneous left brain hemorrhage. History of renal cancer. Evaluate 
for underlying mass lesion as cause. 
 
Technique
Multiple sequences were obtained through the brain without and with 
intravenous gadolinium. 
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent GADAVIST 8 milliliters 01/13/2015 INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
Comparison
Prior brain MR with and without contrast from 09/24/2013 was 
reviewed. 
 
Findings
There is no area of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction.  

 
Again noted there is the area of encephalomalacia and gliosis in the 
left posterior parietal lobe with ex-vacuo dilatation of the adjacent 
portion of the left lateral ventricle. Interval decrease in 
susceptibility in this region likely reflecting resorption of blood 
products.  
 
Again noted is abnormal contrast enhancement immediately posterior 
and superior to the posterior body of the left lateral ventricle 
whichis unchanged from prior studies and is of uncertain nature. 
 
The remainder of the lateral ventricles and 3rd ventricle are mildly 
prominent.  The 4th ventricle is normal.  There is no hydrocephalus.   

 
There is fairly extensive abnormal high signal on the FLAIR sequence 
in the bilateral corona radiata and centrum semiovale which may be 
related to advanced small-vessel disease, chronic watershed ischemia 
or both. There is evidence of small vessel disease in the pons.  
 
Evidence of prior left parietal craniotomy is again noted. There is 
peri dural enhancement as expected deep to the craniotomy.   
 
There is no mass effect, midline shift or other focal parenchymal 
abnormality.    
 
The ventricles are unchanged in size and configuration. 
There is midline shift or new focal parenchymal abnormality.   
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection.  
The pituitary gland is normal in size. 
Normal flow void is noted in the major arteries of the circle of 
Willis.  
There is no significant disease in the paranasal sinuses. 
The orbits are grossly unremarkable.

No significant interval change. 

     1. Left parietal craniotomy with encephalomalacia and gliosis in 
the left parietal lobe. 
     2. Focus of enhancement in the left parietal lobe adjacent to 
the left lateral ventricle, unchanged from prior. Stability in size 
dating back to 06/19/2013 suggests against malignancy however exact 
etiology is unclear Consider followup MRI as per clinical management.
     3. Abnormal high signal on the FLAIR sequence in the bilateral 
corona radiata and centrum semiovale which may be related to advanced 
small-vessel disease, chronic watershed ischemia or both.

Multiple sequences were performed through the brain in multiple 
planes.  
 
Comparison
Outside MRI brain dated 09/29/2014. 
MRI brain dated 03/01/2011. 
 
Findings
There are numerous punctate foci of diffusion hyperintensity centered 
at the gray-white junction of the bilateral cerebral hemispheres with 
associated FLAIR signal abnormality, involving the bilateral frontal, 
parietal and occipital lobes. Some of these foci associated with ADC 
hypointensity, reflecting acuity while the majority appear subacute

There are multiple foci of FLAIR hyperintensity involving the 
bilateral subcortical and periventricular cerebral white matter 
extending into the midbrain and pons, nonspecific but most compatible 
with moderate microvascular ischemic disease. There stable foci of 
susceptibility artifact within the right superior frontal gyrus as

left-to-right midline shift at the level of the frontal horns. 
Several small foci of susceptibility internally are compatible with 
hemosiderin. Early internal cystic changes suggest necrosis. No uncal 
herniation pattern is present. No signal abnormality is noted within 
the closely adjacent prechiasmatic left optic nerve.  
 
There is no hydrocephalus. Multiple foci of T2 FLAIR hyperintensity 
are noted within the cerebral white matter bilaterally, favoring 
moderate small vessel disease.  
There is no extra-axial collection.  
The pituitary gland is normal in size. 
There is normal opacification of the major arteries of the circle of 
Willis.  
There is no significant disease in the paranasal sinuses. 
The orbits are grossly unremarkable. 
 
Impression
Solitary inferior left frontal lobe mass as described, noting close 
proximity to the prechiasmatic left optic nerve, suspicious for 
metastasis given the history of multiple primaries.

numerous Dawson's fingers. Several black holes are noted. There is a 
lesion in the right parietal corona radiata which is periventricular 
and projects is a Dawson's finger. This lesion is T1 hypo intense and 
may have minimal marginal contrast enhancement.  This is equivocal 
since it has a slightly hyperintense rim on the precontrast T1 
images. There is no other suggestion of abnormal contrast 
enhancement.

History and Indication
MULTIPE MYELOMA with SEVERE HEADACHE 
 
 
Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex without intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal 
reconstructions were obtained. . 
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
There is no evidence of acute territorial infarct, acute intracranial 
hemorrhage or focal extra-axial collection there is generalized loss 
of volume of the parenchyma with secondary prominence of the cortical 
sulci and ventricles, more than expected for the patient's age.  
Please correlate with medical and social history. There is no 
evidence of hydrocephalus.  There is no mass effect or midline shift.  

 
The clivus is diffusely heterogeneous with multiple punctate lytic 
lesions. There is focal lucent lesion in the right occipital condyle. 
There is a lobulated lytic lesion in the left frontal calvarium 
measuring 1.1 x 0.7 centimeters, with extension through the inner and 
outer table cortex. There is also a lucent lesion in the right 
parietal calvarium towards the vertex with underlying defect in the 
inner table cortex.  There are multiple additional focal lytic 
lesions throughout the bony calvarium.  
 
There is opacification of the anterior and posterior ethmoids 
bilaterally.  Left maxillary sinus is opacified.  There is near 
complete opacification of the right maxillary sinus.  There is mild 
to moderate mucosal thickening present in both the frontal and 
sphenoid sinuses.  
 
The visualized mastoid air cells are clear.  
 
Impression
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. No mass-effect, 
midline shift or hydrocephalus.  
 
2. Diffusely heterogeneous calvarium and clivus with multiple lytic 
lesions throughout are most compatible with multiple myeloma, given 
the patient's history.  
 
3. Diffuse paranasal sinus disease, as above.

Comparison
Outside MRI brain dated 10/20/2014 
 
Findings
There is no area of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction.  

There are scattered foci of white matter T2 FLAIR hyperintensity, for 
example in the juxtacortical posterior (image 46 series 403) and 
parasagittal anterior right frontal lobe (image 26 series 403), 
periventricular right temporal (image 43 series 403), 2 juxtacortical 
left frontal (images 80 and 45 series 401), periventricular white 
parietal lobe (series 4 a 1 image 94) and mid colossal body white 
matter (image 80 series 401). These do not enhance with contrast and 
are grossly unchanged from the prior examination allowing for 
differences in technique, the specific protocol for which is unknown. 
Several of these lesions are difficult to see on the prior study due 
2 relatively thick slices. No  enhancing, new nonenhancing or 
infratentorial white matter lesion is identified.  
The ventricles are normal. 
There is no mass effect, midline shift or other focal parenchymal 
abnormality.   
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. No 
abnormal contrast enhancement is noted in the brain or leptomeninges. 
The pituitary gland is normal in size. 
Normal flow void is noted in the major arteries of the circle of 
Willis.  
There is no significant disease in the paranasal sinuses. 
The orbits are grossly unremarkable. 
 
Impression
Stable white matter lesions as described, compatible with provided 
history of multiple sclerosis for which do not fully satisfy criteria 
for separation of lesions in the space. No new lesions identified.

CT HEAD ROUTINE WITHOUT CONTRAST  
 
Clinical History
Bilateral arm discoordination (dropping things) and altered mental 
status.  
 
 
Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex. 
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
There is no loss of gray-white matter distinction or other sign of 
acute infarction. There is a subtle hypodensity in the head of the 
right caudate which is favored to represent old lacunar infarct.  
 
The ventricles, cisterns and sulci are age-appropriate in size. 
 
There is no mass effect or midline shift.  
 
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. 
 
The calvarium is intact.  There is a nodular hyperdensity within the 
subcutaneous soft tissues of the scalp overlying the left parietal 
bone (series 5, image 55), which may represent small scalp hematoma 
or sebaceous cyst.  
 
There is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses 
and mastoids. 
 
Impression

     1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or convincing non contrast 
CT evidence of acute transcortical infarct. 
     2. Small subcutaneous scalp hematoma versus sebaceous cyst 
overlying the left parietal bone. No calvarial fracture. Correlate 
with physical examination. 
     3. Findings discussed with the ER resident Dr. Ng at 5:35 p.m. 
on 01/23/2015 by Dr. Shroyer.

Clinical History
CIRCLE OF WILLIS (BRAIN) 
 
 
History and Indication
Bilateral arm discoordination (dropping objects) and altered mental 
status.  
 
Technique
CT perfusion: Before and during a contrast bolus injection, multiple 
5mm thick stacks of perfusion data were collected   .Following this, 
workstation technology was employed to create time of arrival, blood 
flow, mean transit time and blood volume color perfusion maps. 
 
CT angio of the neck: Following rapid IV bolus of contrast material, 
rapid helical imaging with very thin slices from the aortic arch to 
the lower cranial level was performed. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was utilized to create 3-D rendered MIP images.  NASCET 
methodology was employed to evaluate the degree of stenosis. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Following rapid injection of intravenous 
contrast material after an appropriate delay, very thin helical axial 
slices were obtained through the entire head. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was employed to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent OMNIPAQUE 350 135 milliliters 01/23/2015 INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
Comparison
Noncontrast head CT from same day.  
 
Findings
CT perfusion: There is likely artifactual perfusion abnormality in 
the anterior left frontal lobe, most likely related to patient motion 
as there is all no signal detected in this region on the mean transit 
time. Evaluation of cerebral perfusion is limited due to artifact.. 
 
CT angio of the neck/head:  
 
The right common carotid artery is adequate. There is approximately 
60-80 percent focal stenosis at the origin of the right internal 
carotid artery. There is a suggestion of an irregular soft plaque 
throughout the petrous portion of the right internal carotid artery 
and extensive calcified plaque in siphon of the right ICA. These 
mixed plaques in the intracranial portion of the right internal 
carotid artery result in scattered areas of stenosis, and appear most 
severe in the cavernous portion of the right internal carotid artery 
where there is likely at least 70 percent stenosis (image 218, series 
3) where the lumen is poorly seen due to severe narrowing from 
calcified plaque. The right MCA and ACA as well as major branches 
appear patent and are adequately opacified.  
 
The left common carotid artery is adequate. There is short segment, 
approximately 20-40 percent stenosis of the proximal left internal 
carotid artery due to calcified atherosclerotic plaque. There is 
scattered soft and calcified plaque causing scattered areas of 
stenosis of the intracranial right internal carotid artery are from 
the mid petrous portion through the clinoid segment, most severe in 
the region of the lacerum segment where stenosis is approximately 
40-60 percent. The left MCA and ACA as well as major branches appear 
patent and adequately opacified.  
 
There is a coarse calcification at the origin of the left vertebral 
artery and the takeoff is not well seen although this region is 
somewhat limited due to streak artifact from patient's shoulders.  
This may represent a hemodynamically significant ostial stenosis 
versus artifact. The remainder of the vertebrobasilar system is 
relatively spared with only mild atherosclerotic disease and no 
evidence of greater than 30 percent stenosis of the remainder of the 
bilateral vertebral arteries or basilar artery. The posterior 
cerebral arteries and major branches appear patent.  The major 
cerebellar arteries appear adequately opacified. 
 
There is no evidence of aneurysm, AVM, or complete vascular 
occlusion.  
 
 
Impression
CT perfusion: Evaluation of cerebral perfusion is limited secondary 
to artifact /patient motion. Left frontal lobe perfusion defect is 
likely artifactual.  
 
CT angio of the neck/head: 
 
1. Approximately 60-80 percent focal stenosis at the origin of the 
right internal carotid artery.  
 
2. Short segment, approximately 20-40 percent stenosis of the 
proximal left internal carotid artery 
 
3. Moderately severe atherosclerotic disease within the intracranial 
portions of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally causing 
scattered areas of stenosis as described.  Maximal stenosis on the 
right is likely greater than 70 percent.  Maximal stenosis on the 
left is likely approximately 40-60 percent.  
 
4. The origin of the left vertebral artery is not well seen and there 
is associated dense atherosclerotic plaque, which may reflect 
high-grade stenosis although evaluation in this region is limited by 
streak and this may be artifactual. The remainder of the 
vertebrobasilar system is relatively preserved.  
 
5. Major intracranial branches of the internal carotid arteries and 
basilar artery appear preserved.

Comparison
Comparison is made to the prior head CT from 10/23/2012  
 
Findings
There are external devices which resulting in beam hardening 
artifacts and resultant streaking throughout the brain parenchyma 
making evaluation of subtle parenchymal abnormality unreliable.  
 
The brain parenchyma appears diffusely hypodense.  The gray-white 
distinctions are not appreciated. The sulci of both cerebral 
hemispheres appear effaced. This is compatible with diffuse cerebral 
edema.  There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. The arteries 
of the circle Willis and the falx cerebri as well as the tentorium 
appear hyperdense with respect to the edematous brain parenchyma.  
There is also some suggestive of all the bilateral anterior cerebral 
and posterior cerebral artery territory infarctions as well as a 
possible evolving right MCA territory infarction. There is effacement 
of the basilar cisterns along with protrusion of the cerebellar 
tonsils into the foramen magnum by approximately 1 cm. There is mass 
effect upon the right lateral ventricle.  There is a decrease in the 
size of both lateral ventricles as well as the 3rd ventricle and the 
4th ventricle. There is no midline shift. There is evidence of 
bilateral lens surgery. There is no depressed skull- calvarial 
fracture.

Technique
This is an incomplete MRI of the brain with only axial FLAIR and 
diffusion-weighted images obtained, as per the ordering physician's 
request.  
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
 There is no evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest acute 
infarction.  
 
There is no mass effect, midline shift or hydrocephalus.  
 
 there are a few nonspecific foci of punctate FLAIR signal scattered 
within the deep and subcortical white matter of the right frontal and 
left parietal lobes. One of these lesions in the right frontal lobe 
abuts the right frontal horn is oriented somewhat perpendicular to 
the long axis of the right lateral ventricle. There is also a 
punctate FLAIR signal in the pons.  
 
There is moderate mucosal thickening of the maxillary sinuses and 
sphenoid sinuses.  Mild mucosal thickening is present in the anterior 
ethmoids, bilaterally.  
 
 
Impression
No evidence of acute infarction.  
 
Few nonspecific foci of punctate FLAIR signal scattered within the 
supratentorial white matter and the pons.  These are nonspecific with 
a broad differential including vasculitis, infectious/inflammatory 
processes, migraine headaches, demyelination and chronic small vessel 
ischemia.  Please correlate clinically.

Clinical History
HEADACHE 
 
 
History and Indication
84 Y/O FEMALE WITH COUGH, SOB, LIGHTHEADEDNESS 
 
 
Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex. 
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
Motion results in streak artifact and significant image degradation, 
limiting evaluation.  
 
 
There is no definitive CT evidence of acute transcortical infarction.  

Patchy foci of hypoattenuation within the periventricular and 
subcortical white matter without mass effect are most compatible with 
moderate microvascular ischemic changes given presence of 
atherosclerotic calcifications at the skullbase. The right frontal 
periventricular area of hypoattenuation likely represents an age 
indeterminate lacunar infarct.  
 
 
There is mild to moderate age-related cerebral and cerebellar volume 
loss with ex vacuo ventricular prominence.  
 
There is no mass effect, midline shift or other focal parenchymal 
abnormality.  
 
There is no definite intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial 
collection. 
 
The calvarium is intact.  
 
There is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses 
and mastoids. Visualized orbits are unremarkable.  
 
Impression
No definite CT evidence of acute intracranial pathology. Moderate 
microvascular ischemic disease as well as age indeterminate right 
frontal periventricular lacunar infarct.

Contiguous axial CT images of the brain were obtained from the skull 
base to the vertex without intravenous. Contrast and sagittal 
reconstructions. 
 
Comparison
CT head dated 10/20/2014, 09/03/2014, 07/28/2014, and 06/04/2014. 
 
Findings
Right parietal approach ventricular shunt catheter is unchanged in 
position, with the tip traversing the septum pellucidum terminating 
in the anterior left lateral ventricle. The visualized extracranial 
portions of the ventricular shunt catheter are contiguous without 
kinking. The ventricular system is unchanged in size and 
configuration from 10/20/2014, with persistent moderate to severe 
dilatation of the lateral and 3rd ventricles and mild enlargement of 
the 4th ventricle. There is unchanged mild low attenuation in the 
periventricular white matter, most prominent surrounding the temporal 
horns, left more than right. Although nonspecific, this may represent 
transependymal flow of CSF.  
 
There is no loss of gray-white matter distinction or other sign of 
acute infarction. There is no evidence of acute intracranial 
hemorrhage. 
 
The cisterns and sulci are age-appropriate in size.

CT of the head from 12/04/2012  
 
Findings
There is no loss of gray-white matter distinction or other sign of 
acute infarction. Multiple hypodensities are noted throughout the 
deep cortical white matter and periventricular white matter, are 
unchanged and likely secondary to chronic small vessel disease. There 
are old lacunar infarcts involving both basal ganglia and the right 
thalamus. There is an old subcentimeter infarct within the right 
cerebellum. 
Age-related involutional changes are again noted.  
 
There is no mass effect, midline shift or other focal parenchymal 
abnormality.  
 
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. 
 
The calvarium is intact.  
 
There is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses 
and mastoids. Mucoid retention cyst is noted within the left

Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
There is no CT evidence of acute transcortical infarction, 
intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection.  There is no mass 
effect or midline shift.  
 
There is moderate age-related cerebral and cerebellar volume loss.  
There is no hydrocephalus.  
Patchy foci of hypoattenuation within the periventricular and 
subcortical white matter without mass effect are most compatible with 
microvascular ischemic changes given presence of atherosclerotic 
calcifications at the skullbase.  
 
 
The calvarium is intact. There is a focal bony defect in the frontal 
calvarial inner table with soft tissue density inside, likely 
representing an arachnoid granulation. The sella is noted to be 
empty. 
 
Mild mucosal thickening of the ethmoid sinuses are noted. The mastoid 
air cells are clear.  There is soft tissue thickening within the 
bilateral external auditory canals, likely representing cerumen, 
which may be confirmed by physical examination.  
 
Impression
No CT evidence of acute intracranial injury.  
Microvascular ischemic and atherosclerotic calcific disease.

Findings
There is no loss of gray-white matter distinction or other sign of 
acute infarction. There is low attenuation in the periventricular and 
subcortical white matter most likely representing the sequelae of 
chronic small vessel ischemic disease. Again noted is an old lacunar 
infarction in the anterior limb of the left internal capsule.  
 
There are age-related generalized involutional changes with secondary 
prominence of the cortical sulci and ventricular system. There is 
enlargement of the marginal sulcus on the left which may be secondary 
to an arachnoid cyst.  
 
There is no mass effect, midline shift.  
 
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection.  
 
Again noted is a dural based calcification in the left frontal 
region, which may represent a calcified meningioma. Otherwise, the 
calvaria is intact. 
 
There is mild nodular mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus, 
otherwise there is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal 
sinuses and mastoids.

History and Indication
BRAIN TUMOR 
 
 
Technique
Multiple sequences were obtained through the brain without and with 
intravenous gadolinium. 
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent GADAVIST 9 milliliters 01/29/2015 INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
The previously seen focus of enhancement in the right occipital lobe, 
which was felt to reflect  residual tumor on the prior study, has 
shrunken in size in the interim; it currently measures 3 millimeters 
in size whereas previously it measured 5 millimeters in size. There 
is persistent increased T2 signal in the surrounding white matter 
likely reflecting post radiation change ; this is fairly stable from 
the prior study.  There is also a focal fluid collection in the 
medial aspect of the right occipital lobe which is stable from the 
prior study.  
 
There is no area of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction.  

 
The ventricles are normal. 
There is no mass effect or midline shift.  
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection.  
The pituitary gland is normal in size. 
Normal flow void is noted in the major arteries of the circle of 
Willis.  
There is no significant disease in the paranasal sinuses. 
The orbits are grossly unremarkable. 
 
Impression
Interval decrease in size of the previously seen focus of enhancement 
in the right occipital lobe as described above, reflecting positive 
response to treatment. All other findings are unchanged from the 
prior study.

History and Indication
S/P TRAUMA 
 
 
Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex without intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal 
reconstructions were obtained. 
 
Comparison
Head CT dated 09/08/2011.  
 
Findings
There is a small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage interposed between 
the anterior corpus callosum and right cingulate gyrus. There is thin 
right parafalcine subdural hemorrhage along the medial high right 
frontal lobe convexity, measuring 3 MM in thickness. There is no 
associated mass effect.  There is no midline shift. There is no 
evidence of acute territorial infarction.  
 
There is generalized age related volume loss, similar to the prior 
exam. The ventricles are unchanged in size and configuration from the 
prior exam, with persistent moderate enlargement of the lateral and 
3rd ventricles and mild enlargement of the 4th ventricle. There is 
rounding of the frontal horns and prominence of the temporal horns, 
with bowing of the corpus callosum. Although these ventriculomegaly 
may be ex vacuo, an underlying communicating hydrocephalus (i.e. NPH) 
cannot be excluded.  Please correlate clinically.   
 
There are patchy areas of low attenuation in the deep and subcortical 
white matter, similar to the prior exam, representing the sequela of 
chronic small vessel ischemia.  There are vascular calcifications in 
both internal carotid artery siphons. The sella turcica is partially 
empty.  There is no tonsillar herniation.  
 
There is subgaleal hematoma edema and skin laceration overlying the 
posterior right parietal and right occipital calvaria. There is no 
evidence of acute skull fracture.  
 
There is a small fluid level in the left sphenoid sinus. Correlate 
clinically. There is a tiny retention cyst in the right maxillary 
sinus.  Visualized mastoid air cells are clear. Skin staples are 
noted overlying the posterior calvarium.  
 
Impression
1. Mild subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhages, as described above. No 
mass effect or midline shift.  
 
2. Subgaleal hematoma overlying the posterior right parietal and 
right occipital calvarium.  No evidence of acute skull fracture.  
 
3. Stable ventriculomegaly, as described above, unchanged in size 
since 09/08/2011.  Although this may be ex macro, a component of 
communicating hydrocephalus (i.e. the NPH) cannot be excluded.  
Please correlate clinically.  
 
The findings were discussed with Dr. Yu at 9:30 p.m. on 01/27/2015.

MRI from outside institution dated 06/19/2014.  
 
Findings
There are multiple (greater than 9) foci of the white matter T2/FLAIR 
hyperintensity involving juxta cortical (at least 1), subcortical, 
periventricular (greater than 3) and deep white matter. The 
periventricular lesions demonstrate characteristic perpendicular 
orientation in relation to the ventricles.  There are no definite 
lesions visualized in the posterior cranial fossa. This is compatible 
with the provided history of demyelination. None of the lesions 
demonstrate abnormal enhancement or increased restricted diffusion to 
suggest acute process. There is possible new juxtacortical lesion in 
the left superior frontal gyrus, however the prior scan was performed 
at 5 millimeters which limits comparison.  
 
The ventricles, sulci, and cisterns are normal in size and 
configuration.  There is no evidence for acute or subacute evolving 
infarct, intracranial hemorrhage, mass, or extra-axial collection.  
The major intracranial vascular structures demonstrate T2 flow voids. 
The midline structures are normally positioned. The pituitary gland 
is unremarkable.  
 
The orbits and visualized soft tissues are unremarkable.  The 
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.

and aorta are unremarkable. There is mucosal sinus thickening in the 
maxillary sinuses bilaterally.  
The left vertebral artery is not seen at its origin, with flow 
reconstituted proximal to the C5 level were the cervical vertebral 
artery demonstrates areas of marked irregularity and moderately to 
severely diminished caliber. There is normal vessel caliber at the C2 
level extending into the intradural segment.  
There is mild stenosis at the origin of the dominant right vertebral 
artery. The cervical and intracranial vessels demonstrate 
mild-to-moderate segments of irregularity secondary to 
atherosclerotic disease. There is moderate atherosclerotic plaque 
within the right common carotid artery. There is prominent 
atherosclerotic disease of both carotid bulbs. There is approximately 
25 percent stenosis at the origin of the right internal carotid 
artery. There is approximately 55 percent stenosis at the origin of 
the left internal carotid artery. 
There is multilevel discogenic degenerative disease of the cervical 
spine, most prominent at the C5-6 level where severe central canal 
stenosis secondary to a disc osteophyte complex and prominent 
bilateral neural foraminal narrowing is noted. Moderate canal 
stenosis is noted at the level above.

Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
There is no CT evidence of acute transcortical infarction, 
intracranial hemorrhage, or extra-axial collection. There is no mass 
effect or midline shift.  
Patchy foci of hypoattenuation within the periventricular and 
subcortical white matter without mass effect are most compatible with 
moderate microvascular ischemic changes given presence of 
atherosclerotic calcifications at the skullbase. There are more 
well-defined foci of hypoattenuation within the bilateral centrum 
semiovale and basal ganglia which likely represent lacunar infarcts, 
age indeterminate but likely chronic. There is a left basal ganglia 
chronic lacunar infarct versus dilated perivascular space.  
 
 
There is no hydrocephalus.  There is mild to moderate age related 
cerebral and cerebellar volume loss.  
 
The calvarium is intact.  
 
Mastoid air cells are clear.  There are postsurgical changes 
involving the nasal cavity and ethmoid sinuses, with mild to moderate 
residual thickening noted within the nasal cavity and sphenoid

Technique
1.  3D time-of-flight MR angiogram of the circle of Willis was 
performed without intravenous contrast.  3D MIP reformations were 
obtained at a separate workstation.  
 
2. 3D time-of-flight MR angiogram of the neck was performed without 
intravenous contrast. 3D MIP reformations were obtained at a separate 
workstation.  
 
Comparison
No prior studies are available for comparison.   
 
Findings
Neck - this examination is limited by motion, particularly in the 
infrahyoid neck. The origins of the brachiocephalic, left common and 
left subclavian arteries are not included on the field of view.  
 
Right common carotid artery: Origin is patent.  Normal course and 
caliber with no hemodynamically significant stenosis.  
Right internal carotid artery: Origin is patent. Normal course and 
caliber with no hemodynamically significant stenosis throughout the 
cervical segment. 
Right external carotid arteries: Unremarkable. 
 
Left common carotid artery: Evaluation of the inferior left common 
carotid artery is very limited secondary to extensive image 
degradation from motion.  However, there is a grossly normal course 
with no high-grade stenosis.  
Left internal carotid artery origin is patent. Normal course and 
caliber with no hemodynamically significant stenosis through the 
cervical segment.  
Left external carotid artery: Unremarkable.  
 
Vertebral arteries: The left vertebral artery is mildly dominant. 
Difficult to assess the origin of the right vertebral artery 
secondary to image degradation from motion. Origin of the left 
vertebral artery is patent. There is no hemodynamically significant 
stenosis of the vertebral arteries through the V3 segments.  
 
Circle of Willis - This examination is limited by motion and inherent 
limitations of open MRI. If there is continued clinical concern for 
vasculitis, then CTA may be considered.  
 
Anterior circulation: The no hemodynamically significant stenosis. 
Hypoplastic bilateral posterior communicating arteries are patent.  
 
Posterior circulation: There is no hemodynamically significant 
stenosis. There are patent bilateral superior cerebellar arteries, 
bilateral AICAs and left PICA. There is irregularity along the left 
AICA, bilateral superior cerebellar arteries and posterior cerebral 
arteries, which is likely artifact secondary to motion and intrinsic 
limitation of MRA.  
 
There is no evidence of an aneurysm or AVM in the circle of Willis.  
 
Impression
1.  No hemodynamically significant stenosis of the carotid or 
vertebral arteries, within the next.  
 
2. No hemodynamically significant stenosis in the circle of Willis.

Technique
CT angio of the neck: Following rapid IV bolus of contrast material, 
rapid helical imaging with very thin slices from the aortic arch to 
the lower cranial level was performed. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was utilized to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
NASCET methodology was employed to evaluate the degree of stenosis. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Following rapid injection of intravenous 
contrast material after an appropriate delay, very thin helical axial 
slices were obtained through the entire head. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was employed to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent OMNIPAQUE 350 95 milliliters 01/21/2015 
 
 
Comparison
No prior studies are available for direct comparison.  
Noncontrast head CT from 01/21/2015 at 8:53 om was reviewed. 
 
Findings
CT angio of the neck: There is no evidence of hemodynamically 
significant stenosis or occlusion of the right or left carotid and 
vertebral arteries. There is obscuration of the origins of the 
vertebral arteries by streak artifact; evaluation of the proximal 
great vessels as well as the vertebral arteries is limited by the 
same artifact.  
There is enlargement of the main pulmonary trunk, measuring up to 3.6 
centimeters in diameter.  
There is multilevel discogenic degenerative disease of the cervical 
spine.  
 
CT angiography of the head: There is no evidence of AVM, definite 
aneurysm or vascular occlusive disease. 
There is advanced odontogenic and periodontal disease with numerous 
periapical lucencies noted.  There is hypodense expansile lesion 
within the left maxilla measuring approximately 2.0 centimeters 
(series 3, image 169), containing an impacted molar tooth and 
material which is higher than fluid attenuation. There is erosion of 
the cortex of the adjacent lateral and posterior maxilla.

Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex without intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal 
reconstructions were obtained. 
 
Comparison
Head CT dated 06/19/2014.  
 
Findings
A right parietal approach ventriculostomy catheter is again seen 
entering the right lateral ventricle at the trigone, with the tip 
projecting over the mid body of the right lateral ventricle, 
unchanged. Allowing for differences in technique, the ventricular 
system is stable in size and configuration, without enlargement. 
There is no frank hydronephrosis. The visualized extracranial 
portions of the catheter are contiguous without kinking. There has 
been interval resolution of the pneumocephalus. There is unchanged 
encephalomalacia and gliosis with dystrophic calcification in the 
superior right parietal lobe, along a prior catheter tract.  
 
The VP shunt results in streak artifact, which limits evaluation of 
the surrounding parenchyma in the right parieto-occipital lobes and 
right cerebellum. Within these limitations, there is no evidence of 
acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute territorial infarction. There 
is no mass effect or midline shift.  
 
A persistent cavum septum pellucidum again noted. Again 
redemonstrated is a stable round CSF attenuation structure, abutting 
the anterior septum pellucidum.  This may represent a septum 
pellucidum cyst.  
 
There are skin defects overlying the right parieto-occipital 
calvarium. There is a bony defect in the posterior right parietal 
calvarium at the vertex. There is no evidence of acute skull 
fracture.  
 
There is a small fluid level in the left sphenoid sinus with a frothy 
secretions.  Correlate clinically for acute sinusitis.  There is mild 
mucosal thickening along the left frontal recess and anterior left 
ethmoid air cells.

Findings
The patient is status post suboccipital craniectomy with associated 
postsurgical changes. There is a right frontal approach 
ventriculoperitoneal shunt catheter, terminating near the foramen of 
Monro, unchanged from prior. The ventricles are stable in size and 
remain moderately enlarged. There is interval resolution of 
previously noted blood within the bilateral occipital horns. There is 
no evidence of mass effect or midline shift.  No evidence of 
herniation.  
 
There are patchy hypodensities within the white matter consistent 
with chronic small vessel disease. There is stable appearing 
hypodense left frontoparietal subdural collection, may represent 
chronic hematoma versus hygroma. Similar appearing hypodense 
collection is noted along the right frontal falx.  
 
Postsurgical changes are again noted within the posterior fossa with 
encephalomalacia /gliosis in the right cerebellum and embolization 
material, unchanged. There is unchanged in size of hypodense 
collection adjacent to craniectomy in the suboccipital extracranial 
soft tissues which may represent postsurgical collection versus a 
pseudomeningocele.  
 
Left frontal burr hole is again noted.  
 
There is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses 
and mastoids. The orbits are unremarkable.

Contiguous axial CT images of the cervical spine were obtained 
without intravenous contrast. Coronal and sagittal reconstructions 
were obtained.  
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
CT brain:  There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or 
acute transcortical infarct.  Age-related generalized involutional 
changes with secondary prominence of cortical sulci and ventricles. 
There is no mass effect or midline shift.  No evidence of 
hydrocephalus.  There is confluent and patchy low attenuation 
throughout the deep and subcortical white matter and scattered within 
the gangliocapsular regions and right midbrain, representing the 
sequela of moderate small vessel ischemia.  There is a tiny chronic 
lacunar infarct in the right thalamus and small chronic infarct in 
the left frontal centrum semiovale. Vascular calcifications are noted 
in both internal carotid artery siphons. The bony calvarium is 
grossly intact. Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells 
are well aerated.  
 
Alignment of the cervical spine is maintained.  Vertebral body 
heights are maintained.  No evidence of acute fracture.  There is 
disc space narrowing throughout the cervical spine, most severe at 
C4-5, C5-6 and C6-7, where there is endplate sclerosis and spurring. 
Evaluation of the intraspinal canal soft tissues is limited on CT.  
If further information regarding disc herniation, epidural collection 
or cord pathology is clinically warranted, then MRI should be 
obtained. There is posterior facet hypertrophy throughout the 
cervical spine.  There is uncovertebral joint hypertrophy at C3-C4, 
C4-5, C5-6 and C6-7. There is broad disk osteophyte complex at C4-C5 
and posterior hypertrophy with mild canal stenosis.  There is 
moderate stenosis of both neural foramina, right more than left at 
C4-5, secondary posterior facet and uncinate hypertrophy. At C5-6, 
there is a broad disc osteophyte complex and posterior arch 
hypertrophy with moderate canal stenosis.  There is moderate to 
severe stenosis of both neural foramina at C5-6, secondary to 
uncinate hypertrophy and posterior facet hypertrophy. At C6-C7 there 
is a broad disc osteophyte complex resulting in at least moderate 
canal stenosis.  There is moderate to severe bilateral foraminal 
stenosis at C6-7 secondary to posterior facet and uncinate 
hypertrophy.  
 
Thyroid gland is heterogeneous with coarse calcifications. This can 
be correlated with dedicated thyroid sonogram.  Vascular 
calcifications are present in both carotid bulbs. There are 
centrilobular emphysematous changes in the visualized lung apices.  
 
Impression
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or skull fracture. 
Moderate small vessel ischemic changes in the brain, as above.  
 
2. No evidence of acute fracture or traumatic subluxation in the 
cervical spine.  Multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical

Comparison
Outside MRI from 11/18/2014  
 
Findings
 There is no evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest acute 
infarction.  
 
As seen on the prior CT, there has been placement of a left parietal 
approach ventricular shunt catheter, with the distal tip terminating 
within the body of the right lateral ventricle. There is associated 
artifact. There is no hyperintensity indicative of gliosis around the 
catheter tract. There remains moderate enlargement of the lateral and 
3rd ventricles, mildly out of proportion to the degree of age-related 
volume loss, without significant change from the prior studies given 
differences in technique.  
 
There are multiple scattered foci of T2/FLAIR hyperintensities 
throughout bihemispheric subcortical and periventricular white 
matter, without diffusion restriction or mass effect, compatible with 
moderate microvascular ischemic disease.  
 
There is a nonspecific T2 hypointense 0.6 centimeter focus at the 
left parietal vertex which is likely extra-axial and may represent 
calcification or remote hemorrhage. There is no mass, mass effect, 
midline shift or other focal parenchymal abnormality.  
 
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection.  
 
There is moderate mucosal thickening within the right maxillary 
sinus.  Left mastoid air cells are clear. There is mild scattered 
mucosal thickening throughout the paranasal sinuses, with possible 
prior surgery involving the right maxillary sinus. There is a small 
mucous retention cyst or polyp within the left maxillary sinus.  
 
No gross abnormality is noted within the orbits.  
 
Impression
No acute infarction.  No appreciable interval change in ventricular 
size. Moderate microvascular ischemic disease.

Technique
CT perfusion: Before and during a contrast bolus injection, multiple 
5mm thick stacks of perfusion data were collected   .Following this, 
workstation technology was employed to create time of arrival, blood 
flow, mean transit time and blood volume color perfusion maps. 
 
CT angio of the neck: Following rapid IV bolus of contrast material, 
rapid helical imaging with very thin slices from the aortic arch to 
the lower cranial level was performed. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was utilized to create 3-D rendered MIP images.  NASCET 
methodology was employed to evaluate the degree of stenosis. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Following rapid injection of intravenous 
contrast material after an appropriate delay, very thin helical axial 
slices were obtained through the entire head. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was employed to create 3-D rendered and MIP images.

Technique
A multisequential, multiplanar MRI of the brain was performed prior 
to and following the uneventful intravenous administration of 10 
milliliters of Gadavist contrast.  
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent GADAVIST 10 milliliters 01/16/2015 INTRAVENOUS 
 
Comparison
No prior MRI available for comparison.  
 
Correlation is made with CT head performed earlier the  
 
Findings
There is no restricted diffusion in the parenchyma.  No evidence of 
acute infarction. There is an area of encephalomalacia and gliosis in 
the inferior left frontal lobe. This may be the sequela of prior 
traumatic injury. Please correlate clinically and with history.  
 
There are multiple punctate foci of T2/FLAIR signal scattered within 
the deep and subcortical white matter of the supratentorial 
parenchyma. One of these lesions abuts the surface of the left 
frontal horn and is somewhat perpendicular to the long axis of the 
lateral ventricle. There is no evidence of enhancement or restricted 
diffusion within these lesions.  
 
There are no enhancing mass lesions in the parenchyma. There is no 
abnormal intracranial enhancement. There is no mass effect or midline 
shift.  
 
There is mild loss of volume of the parenchymal, with secondary 
prominence of the cortical sulci and ventricles, more than expected 
for the patient's age.  Please correlate with medical and social 
history. Mild prominence of the lateral, 3rd and 4th ventricles is 
most likely ex vacuo.  There is no evidence of hydrocephalus.  
 
There is no tonsillar herniation.  Sella turcica is unremarkable.  
 
There is questionable hyperintense T2 signal within the intraorbital 
right optic nerve.  This however may be technical. Please correlate 
with patient's history. 
 
There are tiny retention cysts in both maxillary sinuses.  There is 
mild mucosal thickening along the ethmoids, bilaterally.  
 
The flow voids in the central arteries of the circle of Willis and 
major dural sinuses are present.  
 
 
Impression
1.  No evidence of acute infarction or space-occupying mass lesion. 
No abnormal intracranial enhancement.  
 
2.  Multiple punctate foci of T2/FLAIR signal scattered within the 
deep and subcortical white matter of the supratentorial parenchyma, 
as above.  These are nonspecific and with a broad differential, 
including demyelination, vasculitis, infectious/inflammatory 
processes as well as advanced chronic small-vessel ischemia.  
 
3. Question signal abnormality in the right optic nerve.  Although 
this may be technical, this could be the sequelae of optic neuritis. 
Please correlate clinically with patient's history. If warranted, a 
dedicated MRI of the orbits may be obtained.  
 
4.  Encephalomalacia and gliosis in the inferior left frontal lobe, 
may be the sequela of prior traumatic injury.

Comparison
Comparison is made to a neck angiogram performed on 01/15/2015.  
 
Findings
Noncontrast CT head: There is no loss of gray-white matter 
distinction or other sign of acute infarction. There is a large coil 
mass in the middle cranial fossa in the vicinity of the basilar tip. 
The ventricles are normal. There is no mass effect, midline shift or 
focal parenchymal abnormality. There is no intracranial hemorrhage or 
extra-axial collection. The calvaria are intact. There is no 
significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoids. 
 
CT angio of the neck:  
 
On the right: Postsurgical changes are evident in the right neck 
secondary to recent right carotid endarterectomy. When compared to 
the images in measurements made on the carotid artery angiogram from 
01/15/2015, there has been marked interval improvement of the severe, 
irregular stenosis involving the proximal cervical internal carotid 
artery, just distal to the bifurcation. Currently, the previously 
stenosed segments involving the C1 segment currently measures 10 
millimeters in diameter (previously measured 1 millimeters in 
diameter). Remaining segments of the right internal carotid artery 
are normal in caliber without significant stenosis.  
 
On the left: There is a stent involving the C1 segment of the left 
internal carotid artery.  There are scattered areas of 
atherosclerotic plaques at without significant stenosis.  
 
The right vertebral artery is dominant and the left vertebral artery 
is diminutive.  However, there are both patent.  
 
CT angiography of the head: Large coil mass again noted in the 
vicinity of the basilar tip which limits evaluation for the 
surrounding vessels. Within the limitations, the remaining 
intracranial vessels demonstrate no aneurysm, AVM, or evidence of 
occlusive disease.  
 
Impression
Noncontrast CT head: No acute intracranial pathology. 
 
CT angio of the neck: Interval resolution of the severely stenosed C1 
segment of the right internal carotid artery, currently it measures 
10 millimeters in caliber (previously measured 1 millimeter).  
 
CT angiography of the head: No aneurysm, AVM, or occlusive disease.

Clinical History
Sudden onset expressive aphasia.  History transient motor loss 
approximately 6 months ago.  
 
 
Technique
CT perfusion: Before and during a contrast bolus injection, multiple 
5mm thick stacks of perfusion data were collected   .Following this, 
workstation technology was employed to create time of arrival, blood 
flow, mean transit time and blood volume color perfusion maps. 
 
CT angio of the neck: Following rapid IV bolus of contrast material, 
rapid helical imaging with very thin slices from the aortic arch to 
the lower cranial level was performed. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was utilized to create 3-D rendered MIP images.  NASCET 
methodology was employed to evaluate the degree of stenosis. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Following rapid injection of intravenous 
contrast material after an appropriate delay, very thin helical axial 
slices were obtained through the entire head. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was employed to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
 
Delayed post contrast images were also obtained 5 min after contrast 
administration.  
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent OMNIPAQUE 350 115 milliliters 12/31/2014 INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
Comparison
Non contrast CT of the head performed earlier on the same day.  
 
Findings
CT perfusion: No area of abnormal perfusion is detected.  
 
CT angio of the neck: There is no evidence of greater than 30% 
stenosis or occlusion of the right or left carotid and vertebral 
arteries. 
 
CT angiography of the head: There is no evidence of aneurysm, AVM or 
vascular occlusive disease. The meningioma within the left parietal 
region appears to be supplied-of branches of the distal portion of 
the P 2 segment of the left posterior cerebral artery.  
 
Delayed CT of the head: There is a avidly enhancing left parasagittal 
extra-axial mass in the left parietal region, as seen on the non 
contrast CT of the head performed earlier on the same day. No other 
enhancing lesions visualized. Pleural-based calcifications as noted 
previously.  
 
Impression
 
CT perfusion: Normal study 
 
CT angio of the neck: No significant abnormality noted. 
 
CT angiography of the head: No evidence of an aneurysm, AVM or 
vascular occlusive disease.  The left parietal region meningioma 
appears to be supplied by branches from the distal portion of the P2 
segment of the left posterior cerebral artery. 
 
Delayed CT of the head: Avidly enhancing extra-axial mass 
corresponding to 4 cm lesion seen earlier in the left parasagittal 
parietal area, highly consistent with meningioma.

Contrast
Contrast Agent GADAVIST 6 milliliters 01/01/2015 INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
Comparison
Noncontrast head CT and CT angiogram of the head and neck dated 
12/31/2014.  
 
Findings
There is vividly inhomogeneously enhancing 3.9 x 4.1 x 4.4 cm 
extra-axial mass which demonstrates T1 and T2 isointense signal in 
relation to the cortex and centered in the left medial parietal 
region.  The mass abuts the adjacent posterior falx and also has 
dural attachment along parietal convexity.  This is consistent with 
parasagittal meningioma. There is moderate associated mass-effect on 
the adjacent parietal lobe.  There is no midline shift or evidence 
for transtentorial herniation. There is no associated edema of the 
adjacent brain parenchyma.   
 
The ventricles, sulci, and fissures are otherwise normal in size and 
configuration.  There is no hydrocephalus.  There is no abnormal 
restricted diffusion, acute intracranial hemorrhage, or extra-axial 
collection. The major intracranial vascular structures demonstrate T2 
flow voids. The pituitary gland is unremarkable. There is 1.7 x 0.5 
cm enhancement within diploic space of the left parietal bone, may 
represent a small intraosseous hemangioma.  
 
The orbits and visualized soft tissues are normal. The visualized 
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  
 
 
Impression
Left parietal parasagittal meningioma with moderate associated mass 
effect.  
Focal enhancement in the diploic space of the left parietal bone may 
represent interosseous hemangioma rather than intraosseous 
meningioma.

CAD S/P CARDIAC CATH, NOW + RHOMBERGS 
 
 
Technique
Multiple sequences were performed through the brain in multiple 
planes.  
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
 There is no evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest acute 
infarction.  
 
There are multiple scattered nonspecific foci of T2/FLAIR 
hyperintensity throughout the bihemispheric subcortical and 
periventricular white matter, without mass effect or restricted 
diffusion. There are foci of chronic lacunar infarction within the 
right thalamus as well as the bilateral lentiform nuclei and left 
external capsule.  
 
There is mild to moderate age related cerebral and cerebellar volume 
loss with ex vacuo ventricular prominence. There is no hydrocephalus. 
There is no mass effect or midline shift.  There is no acute 
intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. There are punctate 
scattered foci of susceptibility artifact within the supratentorial 
and infratentorial parenchyma, most prominent in the region of the 
left anterior thalamus, which may represent foci of remote micro 
hemorrhage and or calcification.  
 
There is mild focal prominence at the expected origin of the left 
posterior communicating artery.  
 
There is no significant disease in the paranasal sinuses. The mastoid 
air cells are clear. No gross abnormality is noted within the orbits.  

 
 
Impression
No evidence of acute infarction.  
Nonspecific foci of signal abnormality throughout the bihemispheric 
white matter likely represent mild to moderate microvascular ischemic 
disease. Multiple chronic lacunar infarcts are noted, as above.  
Scattered foci of susceptibility artifact throughout the 
supratentorial and infratentorial parenchyma may represent foci of 
remote micro hemorrhage and or calcification. In case of the former, 
these findings are suspicious for amyloid angiopathy.  
Mild focal prominence at the expected origin of the left posterior 
communicating artery may represent a small infundibulum or aneurysm.  
Further evaluation may be obtained with MRA.

Head CT of 1 day prior.  
 
Findings
The images are markedly degraded by motion artifact.  There is no 
evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction.  There 
is no definite intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. No 
definite mass effect or midline shift is appreciated.  
 
There are confluent areas of T2/ FLAIR hyperintensity within the 
periventricular and subcortical white matter without mass effect, 
nonspecific but likely related to moderate to advanced small-vessel 
disease. Subtle intraparenchymal abnormality cannot be excluded 
secondary to marked artifact.  
 
There is mild to moderate age-related cerebral and cerebellar volume 
loss with ex vacuo ventricular prominence.  
 
There is a mucous retention cyst or polyp within the left maxillary 
sinus.  
 
Impression 
Markedly limited examination. No evidence of acute infarct. Moderate 
to advanced ischemic disease.

There is no area of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction.  

Again seen are extensive white matter lesions consistent with the 
history of multiple sclerosis.  There are multiple periventricular 
lesions with Dawson fingers configuration, 2 coastal lesions, 
multiple juxta cortical as well as cortical lesions, and multiple 
posterior fossa lesions.  All lesions appear unchanged accounting for 
differences in technique. No new enhancing lesions are seen.  
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. No 
abnormal contrast enhancement is noted in the brain or leptomeninges. 
The pituitary gland is normal in size. 
Normal flow void is noted in the major arteries of the circle of 
Willis.  
 
There is no significant disease in the paranasal sinuses. 
 
Again noted is the mucocele in the left posterior nasopharynx within 
the fossa of Rosenmuller which indents the nasopharyngeal airway of 
the fossa of Rosenmuller.  
The orbits are grossly unremarkable. 
 
Impression
Multiple sclerosis without interval change.

Head CT dated 01/18/2015 and head CT dated 01/19/2015 at 2:14 a.m..  
 
Findings
There is no significant interval change from 01/18/2015. Again 
redemonstrated is slight asymmetric thickening of the left tentorium, 
unchanged from the prior exams. There is no evidence of acute 
intraparenchymal hemorrhage or acute territorial infarction.  There 
is no mass effect or midline shift. There is unchanged mild loss of 
volume of the parenchymal with secondary to prominence of the 
cortical sulci and ventricles.  There is no evidence of 
hydrocephalus. That is also unchanged oval-shaped extra-axial 
calcification along the convexity of the left temporal lobe, 
measuring 0.6 cm in thickness at 1.2 cm in length. This is 
nonspecific but may represent a calcified meningioma.  
 
The bony calvarium is intact. There is unchanged hematoma and edema 
overlying the posterior right parietal and occipital calvarium. There 
is unchanged mild lobulated mucosal thickening in the sphenoid 
sinuses. The visualized mastoid air cells are clear.

Comparison
Prior study dated 12/01/2014. 
 
Findings
The patient is status post left occipital craniotomy.  Again seen is 
a resection cavity within the left cerebellum with a small amount of 
surrounding FLAIR hyperintensity which may represent gliosis or post 
radiation changes. The previously noted subcentimeter enhancing 
lesion involving the anterior margin of the resection cavity is no 
longer visualized on the post-contrast imaging.  
There is no area of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction.  

There are involutional changes.  Ventricular system is unchanged in 
size and configuration. There are focal areas of encephalomalacia and 
gliosis within the periventricular white matter bilaterally which may 
represent prior shunt tracts.  There is small vessel disease.  
There is no mass effect or midline shift. There are areas of 
susceptibility on the gradient imaging located in the region of the 
left cerebellum, within both frontal regions, and along the possible 
shunt tract extending into the region of the right thalamus likely 
representing old hemorrhagic products.  
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. 
No abnormal contrast enhancement is noted in the brain or 
leptomeninges. 
The pituitary gland is normal in size. 
Normal flow void is noted in the major arteries of the circle of

Findings
There is no loss of gray-white matter distinction or other sign of 
acute infarction. Involutional changes are noted.  Again noted are 
confluent areas of hypodensity within the bilateral cerebral white 
matter likely representing advanced chronic small vessel disease. 
There is an old lacunar infarct involving the right caudate nucleus.  
There is no new parenchymal abnormality.  There is no mass effect or 
midline shift.  There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.  
There is no extra-axial collection.  
 
There is dilatation of both lateral ventricles likely cysts related 
to compressive dilatation ventricles due to cortical involutional 
changes and central atrophy from extensive chronic small vessel 
disease. The 3rd and 4th ventricles are unremarkable in size and 
appearance. The size and configuration the ventricles of remained 
stable when compared to the previous study.  
 
The calvarium and skull base appear intact.  
 
There is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses

Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex without intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal 
reconstructions were obtained. 
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
This examination is somewhat limited by motion.  There is no evidence 
of acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute transcribe cortical 
infarct. There is moderate generalized loss of volume of the 
parenchymal, more than expected for the patient's age, with secondary 
prominence of cortical sulci, cerebellar folia and ventricles. There 
are associated prominent bifrontal convexity subarachnoid spaces. 
There is no mass effect or midline shift.  There is column flowing 
through low attenuation in the deep and subcortical white matter and 
patchy foci of low attenuation in the gangliocapsular regions and 
brainstem.  These are most likely the sequela of moderate chronic 
small vessel ischemia. There is no evidence of hydrocephalus. 2 
calcifications are present along both intracranial internal carotid 
arteries. The calvarium is intact. There is no significant disease in 
the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoids. 
 
Impression
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or skull fracture. 
Moderate small vessel ischemic changes.

Findings
Noncontrast CT head: There is no loss of gray-white matter 
distinction or other sign of acute infarction.  
The ventricles, sulci and fissures are prominent, consistent with 
age. No evidence of hydrocephalus. There are extensive hypodensities 
within the white matter consistent with severe chronic small vessel 
disease. There is no mass effect or midline shift. There is no 
intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. There are 
atherosclerotic calcifications in the visualized intracranial carotid 
and vertebral arteries.  
 
There is complete opacification of the right maxillary sinus and near 
complete opacification of the left. This is consistent hemorrhage 
from known right maxillary sinus fractures. The bilateral sphenoid 
sinuses are partially opacified. The frontal sinuses and ethmoid air 
cells are unremarkable. There is a right supraorbital and 
infraorbital soft tissue swelling corresponding to a right orbital 
floor fracture.  
 
CT angio of the neck: Irradiation of the aortic arch and its major 
branches demonstrate multiple calcified and noncalcified 
atherosclerotic plaques without stenosis or evidence for dissection.  
 
Evaluation of bilateral common carotid arteries demonstrate normal 
contour and caliber with scattered atherosclerotic calcifications 
without stenosis or evidence for dissection.  
 
Evaluation of the left cervical internal carotid arteries demonstrate 
extensive predominantly calcified atherosclerotic plaque at the 
bifurcation with associated 80-85% stenosis. The remainder of the 
left cervical internal carotid artery demonstrates normal contour and 
caliber without additional stenosis or evidence for dissection.

MRI of the brain with and without contrast.  
 
Clinical History
Altered mental status. History of CLL, status post recent medical 
treatment.  
 
History and Indication
HX OF REFRACTORY ALL RECENTLY TREATED WITH BLINATUMOMAB 
 
 
Technique
A multisequential, multiplanar MRI of the brain was performed prior 
to and following the intravenous administration of 7 mL of Gadavist 
contrast. 
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent GADAVIST 7 milliliters 01/15/2015 INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
This examination is extremely limited by motion resulting in severe 
image degradation. Flair sequences was not performed because of the 
extensive motion.  
 
Within these limitations there is no evidence of restricted diffusion 
to indicate an acute infarct.  However because of image degradation, 
small acute infarct cannot be excluded.  
 
There is mild generalized loss of volume of the parenchyma secondary 
prominence of the CSF spaces, more than expected for the patient's 
age. Please correlate with medical and social history.  
 
There is no mass effect or midline shift. There are no definite 
enhancing mass lesions in the parenchyma, however, unable to assess 
for leptomeningeal enhancement or small areas of abnormal 
enhancement.  
 
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus.  The flow voids in the central 
arteries of the circle of Willis and major dural sinuses are present.  

 
There are no fluid levels in the visualized paranasal sinuses or 
mastoid air cells.  
 
Impression
Extremely limited examination secondary to motion. No definite acute 
infarct or enhancing intracranial mass lesion. No mass effect or 
hydrocephalus.  
However, because of the extensive motion leptomeningeal disease or 
small intracranial mass lesions cannot be excluded.  
A followup MRI may be obtained with sedation or once the patient can 
better tolerate the entire examination.

were reviewed in soft tissue, subdural and bone windows. Post 
processing reformatted images were produced and reviewed. 
 
Comparison
None 
 
Findings
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute transcortical infarction. 
Calvarial defect related to prior probable craniotomy/burr hole in 
the right frontal skull posteriorly; there is a focus of 
calcification/ossification extending intracranially at the defect 
site. In addition, there is subjacent hypodensity compatible with 
gliosis/encephalomalacia. Areas of low attenuation in the 
periventricular and subcortical white matter, a nonspecific finding 
however most likely secondary to mild chronic small vessel ischemic 
disease. No extra-axial collection or midline shift. Involutional 
changes are noted. No hydrocephalus. No acute depressed skull 
fracture. The imaged portions of the orbits, paranasal sinuses and

Clinical History
Right-sided stroke like symptoms. 
 
Technique
CT angio of the neck: Following rapid IV bolus of contrast material, 
rapid helical imaging with very thin slices from the aortic arch to 
the lower cranial level was performed. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was utilized to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
NASCET methodology was employed to evaluate the degree of stenosis. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Following rapid injection of intravenous 
contrast material after an appropriate delay, very thin helical axial 
slices were obtained through the entire head. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was employed to create 3-D rendered and MIP images.

Findings
CT angio of the neck: There is no evidence of greater than 30% 
stenosis or occlusion of the right or left carotid and vertebral 
arteries. Incidental note is made of the left vertebral artery 
originating directly from the aortic arch. There is atherosclerotic 
disease involving the proximal portions of the cervical segments of 
both internal carotid arteries.  
 
CT angiography of the head: There is no aneurysm or arteriovenous 
malformation.  There is some posterior vasculature with left middle 
cerebral artery territory including portions of the left temporal and 
parietal lobes. There is atherosclerotic disease involving the 
cavernous segments of of both internal carotid arteries.  
 
CT perfusion: There is a perfusion defect involving the left middle 
cerebral artery territory some of which corresponds to the old 
infarcts seen on the non contrast head CT.  
 
Impression
Perfusion defect involving the left middle cerebral artery territory 
which appears larger than the known old infarct raising the 
possibility of superimposed acute ischemia. Correlation with 
diffusion imaging is recommended for further evaluation. Some paucity 
of vasculature in this region.

Clinical History
Trauma with head injury. Intracranial hemorrhage. Followup.  
 
 
History and Indication
Status post fall with intracranial hemorrhage.  
 
 
Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex without intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal 
reconstructions were obtained. 
 
Comparison
Head CT dated 01/18/2015.  
 
Findings
Redemonstrated is grossly stable acute subarachnoid hemorrhage 
confined to the sulci in the left frontal and right frontoparietal 
lobes, at the vertex. There is no evidence of acute transcortical 
infarction. There is no mass effect or midline shift.  There are 
generalized age-related involutional changes with secondary 
prominence of cortical sulci and ventricles, without evidence of 
hydrocephalus. There are confluent areas of low attenuation in the 
deep and subcortical white matter, similar to the prior exam, likely 
a sequela of moderate small vessel ischemia. Vascular calcifications 
are present in both internal carotid artery siphons.  
 
Bony calvarium is grossly intact.  There is diffuse paranasal sinus 
disease with fluid level layering in the left frontal sinus and left 
maxillary sinus.  There is near complete opacification of the 
anterior ethmoid air cells, bilaterally.  Mucosal thickening and 
fluid levels are also present in both sphenoid sinuses.  The 
visualized mastoid air cells are clear. There is unchanged partially 
calcified lesion in the subcutaneous fat and skin overlying the left 
parietal calvarium at the vertex.  This is nonspecific but may 
represent a sebaceous cyst. Please correlate with physical exam. 
Nonspecific mild prominence and tortuosity of both optic nerve sheath 
complexes are similar to the prior exam.  
 
 
Impression
Grossly stable subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left frontal and right 
frontoparietal sulci.  Otherwise, no significant interval change from 
01/18/2015.

History and Indication
HEADACHE. 
 
 
Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex without intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal 
reconstructions were obtained. 
 
Comparison
No prior head CT available for comparison. 
 
Findings
Evaluation for intracranial mass lesions is somewhat limited without 
intravenous contrast.  If there is continued clinical concern for 
intracranial metastasis, then contrast-enhanced MRI would be more 
sensitive.  
 
There is no evidence of acute territorial infarct or acute 
intracranial hemorrhage.  There is no mass effect, midline shift or 
hydrocephalus.   
 
No evidence of skull fracture.  There is a 1.0 x 0.4 cm focal area of 
low attenuation in the diploic space of the left frontal bone (image 
29 series 3). There is also a 0.4 x 0.3 cm low attenuation focus in 
the left temporal bone (image 22 of series 3).  
 
The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well 
aerated.  
 
Impression
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. No mass effect, midline 
shift or hydrocephalus.  
 
2 bony lesions in the left frontal and left temporal bone, as above. 
These are nonspecific, but metastatic bone lesions are not excluded.

 CT ANGIO HEAD AND NECK WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST INCLUDING POST 
PROCESSING  
 
Clinical History
Acute AML with facial droop.  Neurologic deficit.  
 
Technique
CT angio of the neck: Following rapid IV bolus of contrast material, 
rapid helical imaging with very thin slices from the aortic arch to 
the lower cranial level was performed. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was utilized to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
NASCET methodology was employed to evaluate the degree of stenosis. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Following rapid injection of intravenous 
contrast material after an appropriate delay, very thin helical axial 
slices were obtained through the entire head. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was employed to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
 
Post processed perfusion maps were obtained.  
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent OMNIPAQUE 350 130 milliliters 12/23/2014 INTRAVENOUS 
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. Correlation is made with the non 
contrast head CT performed at the same time.  
 
Findings
CT angio of the neck: The origins of the great vessels are patent off 
the aortic arch.  There is a bovine aortic arch. The common carotid 
and internal carotid arteries are normal in caliber with no 
significant stenosis. The internal carotid arteries demonstrate a 
mildly retropharyngeal course at the level of C2. The origins of the 
vertebral arteries are patent. The left vertebral artery is mildly 
dominant.  There is no hemodynamically significant stenosis along the 
vertebral arteries.  There is mild calcification in the proximal V4 
segments.  
 
There is diffuse soft tissue fullness in Waldeyer's ring with 
asymmetric soft tissue fullness along the left nasopharynx, which is 
associated with effacement of the fossa of Rosenmuller.  There is 
also asymmetric prominent soft tissue along the left tonsillar pillar 
with effacement of the underlying parapharyngeal fat. There is also a 
asymmetric fullness of the left torus tubarius. There is diffuse soft 
tissue fullness at the base of the tongue. Although these may 
represent hypertrophied tonsils and adenoids, underlying lesions 
cannot be excluded.  Please correlate with direct visualization.  
 
Secretions are noted layering dependently in the hypopharynx. 
Secretions are also noted partially effacing the left vallecula. 
There is asymmetry effacement of the right piriform sinus, which is 
likely secondary to underdistention and secretions. There is mild 
thickening of the epiglottis.  
 
There is lobulated polypoid soft tissue in the left posterior nasal 
cavity, directly adjacent to the inferior turbinate.  There is 
lobulated mucosal thickening and/ or retention cyst in the left 
maxillary sinus.  There is widening of the left maxillary 
infundibulum.  
 
There are mildly enlarged level 2A lymph nodes, bilaterally, 
measuring 2.0 cm on the right and 1.9 cm on the left. There is a 0.9 
cm right level 3 lymph node and 0.8 cm right level 4 lymph node. 
There are additional subcentimeter level 4 and level 3 lymph nodes in 
the neck, bilaterally. There are bilateral level 1B lymph nodes with 
fatty hila, which are not enlarged by size criteria. All  
 
CT angiography of the head: There is no occlusion or hemodynamically 
significant stenosis in the anterior and posterior circulations. 
There is no evidence of aneurysm or gross AVM in the circle of 
Willis.  
 
Perfusion maps: Within the right temporal lobe, there is asymmetric 
prolonged MTT with relatively decreased CBF with no corresponding 
asymmetry in cerebral blood volume.  
 
Impression
CT angio of the neck: No hemodynamically significant stenosis in the 
carotid or vertebral arteries, within the neck. 
 
Borderline sized cervical lymph nodes, as above. In this patient with 
AML, these may be neoplastic. 
 
Diffuse soft tissue fullness in Waldeyer's ring, with asymmetric 
fullness along the left tonsillar pillar, left nasopharynx and left 
torus tubarius. Please correlate with direct visualization to exclude 
underlying neoplasm. 
 
CT angiography of the head: No occlusion or hemodynamically 
significant stenosis in the circle of Willis. 
 
Perfusion maps: Asymmetric prolonged MTT with relatively decreased 
CBF in the anterior right temporal lobe.  No corresponding asymmetry 
in CBV to denote a core infarct. These findings are nonspecific, but 
may reflect tissue at risk. If there is continued clinical concern 
for infarct, then MRI may be obtained.

Technique
Multiple contiguous axial images were obtained from the skull base to 
the vertex without administration of intravenous contrast. Images 
were reviewed in soft tissue, subdural and bone windows. Post 
processing reformatted images were produced and reviewed. 
 
Comparison
None 
 
Findings
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute transcortical infarction. 
There are areas of low attenuation in the periventricular and 
subcortical white matter, a nonspecific finding however most likely 
secondary to chronic small vessel ischemic disease. No extra-axial 
collection or midline shift. Involutional changes are noted. No 
hydrocephalus. No acute depressed skull fracture. The native left 
lens is not seen, suggestive of prior cataract surgery. The frontal 
sinus is hypoplastic. The imaged portions of the remaining paranasal 
sinuses and mastoid air cells appear unremarkable. Intracranial 
calcified arteriosclerotic vascular plaques are present, notably of 
the left vertebral artery.

Findings
Again noted is a stable extra-axial lesion within the left frontal 
convexity best demonstrated on the T2 weighted axial image 23 
compatible for meningioma. There are postoperative changes consistent 
with a right frontoparietal temporal craniotomy.  Involutional 
changes are noted.  There is a focal area of encephalomalacia within 
the right basal ganglia as well as focal areas of encephalomalacia 
with hemosiderin deposition from prior hemorrhage within the right 
inferior frontal lobe. There is no mass effect and midline shift. 
There is some residual soft tissue density best demonstrated on the 
FLAIR and T1 weighted sequences within the suprasellar cistern which 
may represent residual a craniopharyngioma. For more thorough 
evaluation and follow up MRI with the patient under sedation or 
general anesthesia is recommended with and without IV contrast.  
 
Impression
Limited study secondary to motion artifact.  The patient was unable 
to tolerate further imaging. No IV contrast was administered. Soft

Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex. 
 
Comparison
Prior study dated 01/18/2015. 
 
Findings
The patient is status post right parietal/occipital craniotomy. There 
are surgical clips in this region. Again seen are areas of 
encephalomalacia and gliosis involving the right parietal lobe. Again 
seen is a nondisplaced fracture extending through the right parietal 
bone. Again seen is a right-sided predominantly hyperdense subdural 
collection within the right parietal, right frontal, and right 
temporal regions which appears decreased in size.  There is some mass 
effect upon the underlying brain parenchyma. There is a small 
extra-axial hyperdense collection within the left parietal region 
which also appears decreased in size with some mass effect upon the 
underlying brain parenchyma. There are grossly stable scattered areas 
of subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Again seen is an area of hypoattenuation 
within the inferior left frontal lobe with associated areas of 
hemorrhage likely representing a hemorrhagic contusion. Again seen is 
a small amount of subdural hemorrhage within the interhemispheric 
fissure anteriorly. Again seen is a minimal amount of hemorrhage 
within the ventricular system which appears slightly decreased in 
amount when compared to the prior study. There is no midline shift.  
 
The jugular system is unchanged in size and configuration.  There are 
involutional changes.  There is small vessel disease.  There is no CT 
evidence of acute territorial infarct. The basal cisterns are patent.  
There are multiple vascular calcifications. 
 
There is minimal mucosal thickening within both ethmoid sinuses.  
There is no significant mastoid air cell disease. 
 
Impression
Slightly improved extra-axial collections as described above.  
Stable scattered areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage.  
Stable subdural hemorrhage within the interhemispheric fissure 
anteriorly.  
Minimal amount of intraventricular hemorrhage which appears slightly 
improved.  
Stable hemorrhagic contusion within the left inferior frontal lobe.

CTA head and neck with perfusion 
 
Clinical History
Prior electronic record: Patient with history of AVM status post 
partial resection, presenting with double vision and nausea. Chronic 
dense left posterior cerebellar artery identified on outside head CT.  

 
Technique
CT perfusion: During a contrast bolus injection, 16 5mm thick stacks 
of perfusion data were collected intracranially.Following this, 
workstation technology was employed to create blood flow, mean 
transit time and blood volume color perfusion maps. 
 
CT angio of the neck: Following rapid IV bolus of contrast material, 
rapid helical imaging with very thin slices from the aortic arch to 
the lower cranial level was performed. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was utilized to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
NASCET methodology was employed to evaluate the degree of stenosis. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Following rapid injection of intravenous 
contrast material after an appropriate delay, very thin helical axial 
slices were obtained through the entire head. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was employed to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent OMNIPAQUE 350 125 milliliters 01/10/2015 INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison.  
 
Findings
CT perfusion: Posterior fossa cannot be evaluated since most of it is 
not included and there is significant artifact from surgical clips. 
Lack of perfusion is also noted corresponding to the area of the 
dilated left occipital horn. Otherwise, there is no evidence of 
supratentorial perfusion deficit.  
 
CT angio of the neck: There is no evidence of any stenosis or 
occlusion of the right or left carotid and vertebral arteries. The 
left vertebral artery is dominant.  
 
CT angiography of the head: There is a diminutive left posterior 
cerebellar artery with nonvisualization past the P1 segment and 
decreased vasculature within the left occipital lobe. No evidence for 
aneurysm. Surgical clips are identified in the left occipital lobe, 
causing streak artifact. No residual AVM is recognized.  
 
Impression
CT perfusion: No significant abnormality to suggest acute perfusion 
defect. Lack of perfusion and areas of porencephaly in the left 
occipital lobe.  
 
CT angio of the neck: No significant abnormality noted. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Diminutive left posterior cerebral artery 
with nonvisualization past P1 segment and decreased vasculature 
within the left occipital lobe. Surgical clips within the left 
occipital lobe should be correlated with surgical history and prior 
imaging if available.

No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
Abnormal T2 FLAIR hyperintense signal in the paramedial left midbrain 
with hyperintense B1000 signal and suggestion of hypointense signal 
in this region on ADC. Findings concerning for acute infarction in a 
patient with acute left CNIII palsy. 
 
T2 FLAIR hyperintensities are seen in the bilateral deep cerebral 
white matter which are nonspecific and likely represent small vessel 
disease.  
 
The cavernous sinuses are grossly unremarkable in appearance on this 
noncontrast enhanced examination.  
 
Surgical clips in the left occipital lobe result in susceptibility 
artifact which limits evaluation of adjacent structures. There is 
encephalomalacia and gliosis in this region wit ex-vacuo dilatation 
of the occipital horn of the left lateral ventricle. 
 
The ventricles, cisterns and sulci are otherwise age appropriate in 
size.  
 
Prominent vein extending from the right lateral ventricle to the

Technique
Multiple sequences were performed through the brain in multiple 
planes.  
 
Comparison
Head CT without contrast from 01/26/2015. 
 
Findings
The study is limited due to susceptibility artifact from the 
patient's dental hardware. In particular this limits evaluation of 
the inferior aspect of the posterior fossa as well as the orbits and 
paranasal sinuses. The diffusion-weighted sequences are also limited 
due to susceptibility artifact.  There is no focus of restricted 
diffusion involving the visualized portions of brain parenchyma given 
the limitations of diffusion imaging. There is no evidence of 
heterotopic gray matter formation or evidence of a migrational 
disorder.  The bilateral hippocampi by appear symmetrical and 
unremarkable in appearance. There is no focal parenchymal abnormality 
involving the visualized portions of brain parenchyma.  There is no 
mass effect or midline shift.  The ventricles and cisterns are 
unremarkable. There is a new posterior fossa arachnoid cyst located 
just right of midline causing some remodeling the inner table of the 
right suboccipital calvarium. This measures 4.1 cm in height x 2.72 
cm in length by 3.03 cm in width. This is remained unchanged in 
comparison to the prior head CT. There is no gross evidence of 
intracranial hemorrhage.  
 
Impression
Limited study due to significant susceptibility artifact created by 
the the patient's dental hardware.  Stable posterior fossa arachnoid 
cyst just right of midline. No evidence of a migrational disorder, 
heterotopic gray matter formation or abnormality involving the medial 
temporal lobes including the hippocampi. No focal parenchymal 
abnormality involving the visualized portions of the brain 
parenchyma. .

Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
There is a left parietal scalp hematoma measuring approximately 1.8 
cm in maximal thickness. There is a small subdural hematoma along the 
right frontotemporoparietal lobes with maximum thickness of 
approximately 4 mm at the vertex. There is suggestion of ill-defined 
hyperdensity along the sulci of the right parietal lobe seen best on 
series 4 image 14 which may represent a component of subarachnoid 
hemorrhage.  There is effacement of the sulci on the right suggestive 
of edema in the setting of hemorrhage and fracture. There is minimal 
left-to-right midline shift . 
 
There is a comminuted fracture of the left parietal bone extending to 
the left temporal bone to the left TMJ without evidence of 
dislocation. There is partial opacification of the left mastoid air 
cells.  
 
 
There is no loss of gray-white matter distinction or other sign of 
acute infarction. 
 
There is layering hyperdensity within the right sphenoid sinus, 
suspicious for hemorrhage.  Facial bones are not completely imaged on 
this study.  However, no definitive fracture is identified.  
 
Impression

     1. Right frontoparietal subdural collection measuring 
approximately 4 mm in maximal thickness at the vertex. The right 
temporoparietal portion is smaller. Minimal resultant midline shift 
with mild mass effect on the right. There is a small amount of 
adjacent right temporal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Minimal leftward 
midline shift. 
     2. Comminuted fracture extending from the left parietal bone to 
the left temporal bone with left parietal scalp hematoma. on these 
images is not possible to adequately assess for left otic capsule 
involvement. Recommend dedicated CT of the left temporal bone. 
     3. Layering hyperdensity within the right sphenoid sinus, 
suspicious for hemorrhage, to be correlated with dedicated facial 
bone CT 
     4. Asymmetric enlargement of the left lateral ventricle which is 
nonspecific. .
Findings and recommendations were discussed with Dr. Nwakanma by Dr. 
Jacob, radiology resident on call on 01/09/2015 approximately 4:50

Clinical History
Known intraventricular hemorrhage with altered mental status. .  
 
Technique
CT angio of the neck: Following rapid IV bolus of contrast material, 
rapid helical imaging with very thin slices from the aortic arch to 
the lower cranial level was performed. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was utilized to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
NASCET methodology was employed to evaluate the degree of stenosis. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Following rapid injection of intravenous 
contrast material after an appropriate delay, very thin helical axial 
slices were obtained through the entire head. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was employed to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent OMNIPAQUE 350 95 milliliters 01/15/2015 
 
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison.  
 
Findings
CT angio of the neck: There is no evidence of greater than 30% 
stenosis or occlusion of the right or left carotid and vertebral 
arteries. Patient is status post intubation.  
 
CT angiography of the head: There is contrast enhancement of a large 
curvilinear tubular structure with adjacent reticulated network of 
enhancing small curvilinear structures in the medial posterior right 
cerebellum. This most likely represents an arteriovenous 
malformation. In addition there is evidence of atresia (likely 
congenital) of the right transverse sinus. There is no evidence of 
aneurysm. The external carotid arteries are symmetric.

Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
The patient is status post left frontal craniotomy. There is a 
porencephalic cyst in the left frontal region which indicates with 
the frontal horn of the left lateral ventricle. There is a complex 
lesion within the porencephalic cyst in the left frontal region 
measuring 2.1 x 3.5 cm which demonstrates areas of fat attenuation 
and calcification likely representing a dermoid. There are multiple 
subcentimeter hypodense foci scattered throughout the subarachnoid 
spaces and within the ventricular system which demonstrates negative 
Hounsfield attenuation and may represent fat droplets. There is 
volume loss within the left frontal region.  
 
There is no loss of gray-white matter distinction or other sign of 
acute infarction. 
 
There is dilatation of the lateral and 3rd ventricles. The 4th 
ventricle is not significantly dilated.  There is small vessel 
disease. There are involutional changes.  There are multiple vascular 
calcifications. 
 
 there is streak artifact within both frontal regions without 
definite acute intracranial hemorrhage.  There is no definitive 
extra-axial collection.  
 
There is no acute calvarial fracture. 
 
There is a small polyp versus retention cyst within the left 
maxillary sinus.  There is a subcentimeter osteoma within the right 
ethmoid sinus.  There is no significant mastoid air cell disease. 
 
There is partial visualization of a possible sebaceous cyst within 
the subcutaneous tissues of the right occipital scalp region.  
 
Impression
1. Limited study without definitive CT evidence of acute intracranial 
traumatic injury.  
2. Findings as described above which may represent a dermoid with 
prior rupture.  Correlate with outside imaging and with MRI imaging 
if warranted.  
3. Dilated lateral and 3rd ventricles concerning for hydrocephalus.  
4. Postsurgical changes within the left frontal region as described 
above.

There is no definite CT evidence of acute territorial infarction. 
 
There is mild age-related cerebral and cerebellar volume loss with ex 
vacuo ventricular prominence.  
Patchy foci of hypoattenuation within the periventricular and 
subcortical white matter without mass effect are most compatible with 
microvascular ischemic changes given presence of atherosclerotic 
calcifications at the skullbase.  
 
 
There is no mass effect, midline shift or other focal parenchymal 
abnormality.  
 
There is no gross intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. 
 
The calvarium is intact.  
 
There is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses 
and mastoids. The visualized orbits are unremarkable.  
 
Impression
Motion degraded examination. No definite CT evidence of acute 
intracranial abnormality. Diffusion-weighted MRI is significantly 
more sensitive for subtle ischemia.

 CT ANGIO HEAD AND NECK WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST INCLUDING POST 
PROCESSING  
 
Clinical History
No phonation. 
 
Technique
CT angio of the neck: Following rapid IV bolus of contrast material, 
rapid helical imaging with very thin slices from the aortic arch to 
the lower cranial level was performed. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was utilized to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
NASCET methodology was employed to evaluate the degree of stenosis. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Following rapid injection of intravenous 
contrast material after an appropriate delay, very thin helical axial 
slices were obtained through the entire head. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was employed to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
 
Contrast
100 cc of 300 Omnipaque was administered intravenously.  
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison.  
 
Findings
CT angio of the neck: There is no evidence of hemodynamically 
significant stenosis or occlusion of the right or left carotid and 
vertebral arteries. Small calcified plaques are noted in bilateral 
internal carotid arteries with resultant mild vessel irregularity. 
Calcified plaque is noted within the C4 segment of the left vertebral 
artery with mild to moderate stenosis. 
Proximal great vessels and their origins as well as the origins of 
vertebral arteries are partially obscured by streak artifact arising 
from contrast within the venous system. The origins of the left 
nondominant left vertebral artery and right common carotid artery are 
not well seen.  
There is an 8 millimeter nodule within the left thyroid lobe.  
There is mild scarring involving the lung apices bilaterally.  
Multilevel disk degeneration disease of the cervical spine with 
mild-to-moderate canal stenosis suspected at C3-4, C4-5 and to a 
lesser degree C6-7 levels secondary to multilevel disc osteophyte 
complexes. There is superimposed multilevel neural foraminal 
narrowing secondary to uncovertebral facet hypertrophic changes.  
 
CT angiography of the head: There is no evidence of hemodynamically 
significant stenosis, definite aneurysm or vascular malformation. 
There is a fetal origin of the left posterior cerebral artery, a 
normal variant.  
 
CT perfusion: There is no significant asymmetry in the above volume, 
blood flow or mean transit time perfusion studies.  
 
 
Impression
CT perfusion: No significant asymmetry noted. Diffusion-weighted MRI 
is significantly more sensitive for subtle acute ischemia.  
 
CT angio of the neck: No evidence of hemodynamically significant 
stenosis. Calcified plaques within the bilateral internal carotid and 
the C4 segment of the left vertebral arteries, as above.  
Subcentimeter left thyroid lobe nodule, consider evaluation with 
nonemergent ultrasound.  
Multilevel discogenic degenerative disease, as above.  
 
CT angiography of the head: No significant abnormality.

Clinical History
Intracranial hemorrhage, for followup evaluation  
 
 
Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex. 
 
Comparison
Prior CT head dated December 5, 2014.  
 
Findings
There are enlarging foci of hyperdensity within the previously 
described right inferior frontal lobe contusion, consistent with 
evolving hemorrhage. There is hypoattenuation within the posterior 
left temporal lobe compatible with resolving contusion. The 
previously described left frontotemporoparietal subdural hematoma 
demonstrates near complete interval resolution with perhaps trace 
collection remaining. Small The previously described hypodense right 
frontal convexity extra-axial collection has decreased in size, now 
measuring approximately 4 mm in greatest thickness.  There is no 
midline shift. The basal cisterns are patent.  There is no tonsillar 
herniation.  
Small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage remains within the 
bilateral occipital horns, greater on the right. There is been mild 
interval enlargement of the lateral and 3rd ventricles compared to 
the prior study, without hydrocephalus given degree of moderate 
volume loss. 
 
There is complete opacification of the left frontal sinus and left 
sphenoid sinus, as well as moderate opacification of the ethmoid air 
cells, left greater than right. Multiple maxillofacial fractures are 
again identified, evaluated to better advantage on the prior CT of 
the face. The mastoid air cells are clear.  
 
Impression
Enlarging areas of hemorrhage within the right inferior frontal lobe 
contusion. No worsening mass effect or midline shift.  
Decreasing bilateral extra-axial collections. Evolving left temporal 
lobe contusion.  
Persistent in intraventricular hemorrhage, with slight interval 
increase in ventricular size without hydrocephalus given degree of 
volume loss.

Clinical History
EVALUATE FOR CVA (CODE BAT PATIENT) 
 
 
History and Indication
CODE BAT R FACIAL DROOP.  History of atrial fibrillation.  
 
 
Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex. 
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
There is no loss of gray-white matter distinction or other sign of 
acute infarction. 
 
There is asymmetric ex vacuo dilatation of the left occipital horn, 
likely secondary to remote occipital stroke.  There is a small focal 
hypodensity in the right posterior corona radiata (series 2, image 
40), favored to represent a chronic infarct. Scattered 
periventricular and deep cortical white matter hypodensities are 
nonspecific in etiology but favored to represent chronic 
microvascular changes.  
 
There is no mass effect or midline shift. Involutional changes are 
consistent with patient's age.  
 
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. 
 
The calvarium is intact.  
 
A mucous retention cyst is partially visualized within the right 
maxillary sinus. The paranasal sinuses and mastoids are otherwise 
clear.  
 
Impression

     1. No intracranial hemorrhage or convincing non contrast CT 
evidence of acute transcortical infarct.

History and Indication
Right facial droop.  History of atrial fibrillation.  
 
 
Technique
CT perfusion: Before and during a contrast bolus injection, multiple 
5mm thick stacks of perfusion data were collected   .Following this, 
workstation technology was employed to create time of arrival, blood 
flow, mean transit time and blood volume color perfusion maps. 
 
CT angio of the neck: Following rapid IV bolus of contrast material, 
rapid helical imaging with very thin slices from the aortic arch to 
the lower cranial level was performed. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was utilized to create 3-D rendered MIP images.  NASCET 
methodology was employed to evaluate the degree of stenosis. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Following rapid injection of intravenous 
contrast material after an appropriate delay, very thin helical axial 
slices were obtained through the entire head. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was employed to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
 
Contrast

Non contrast head CT from same date.  
 
Findings
CT perfusion: There is increased mean transit time in the 
distribution of the left MCA territory with relatively preserved 
blood flow and blood volume.  There is increased mean transit time 
and decreased blood flow and volume and the left PCA distribution 
consistent with known chronic occipital lobe infarct.  
 
CT angio of the neck: There is calcified atherosclerotic plaque at 
the origin of the left internal carotid artery causing extremely 
short segment 30-50 percent stenosis. There is no evidence of greater 
than 30% stenosis or occlusion of the right carotid and bilateral 
vertebral arteries. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Left A1 not well seen representing 
absence or marked hypoplasia of the left A1 segment with collateral 
flow into the A2 segment via the anterior communicating artery. There 
is high-grade short-segment stenosis of the left P1 segment. There is 
no evidence of aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation.  
 
 
Impression
CT perfusion: Increased mean transit time in the left MCA territory 
with relatively preserved blood volume and blood flow.  These 
findings are favored to represent ischemia, rather than infarct. 
Fixed perfusion defect in the left PCA territory consistent with 
known ipsilateral occipital lobe infarct.

anticoagulation.  
 
 
Technique
Multiple sequences were performed through the brain in multiple 
planes.  
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
There are multiple subcentimeter foci of diffusion hyperintensity 
with variable associated signal intensity on FLAIR imaging.  
-There is a 0.6 cm nodular foci of restricted diffusion within the 
left postcentral gyrus (series 100, image 23), without associated

inferior right frontal lobe (series 100, image 16), without 
associated FLAIR hyperintensity. There is also a punctate area of 
restricted diffusion in the right occipital lobe on the same slice.  
-There is a 0.5 cm region of restricted diffusion in the right 
containment and posterior limb of the internal capsule (series 100, 
image 14), with associated FLAIR hyperintensity

left occipital lobe (series 100, images 9-12), two of which 
demonstrated associated FLAIR hyperintensity.  
-There are at least 3 foci of restricted diffusion within the 
cerebellum(series 100 images 4-6), the largest on the right side 
measuring up to 1.0 cm demonstrating associated FLAIR hyperintensity.  

 
There are additional small foci of diffusion hyperintensity without 
corresponding ADC signal abnormality compatible with subacute 
infarcts. There are additional foci of FLAIR signal abnormality 
within the subcortical and periventricular white matter, nonspecific 
are most compatible with mild to moderate microvascular ischemic 
disease. There is moderate cerebral and cerebellar volume loss ex 
vacuo ventricular prominence.  There is no midline shift.  There is 
no extra-axial collection.  
 
 
Impression

Comparison
Head CT performed earlier the same day. 
 
Findings
 
Redemonstrated is a large area of encephalomalacia and gliosis 
involving the right frontal, parietal and posterior temporal lobes 
consistent with an old right MCA infarct. There are 2 areas of 
apparent restricted diffusion involving the right frontal lobe and 
the right parietal lobe which may be on the basis of residual blood 
products. These correspond to areas of dystrophic calcification seen 
on recent CT. There is no evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest 
acute infarction. There is prominent areas of low signal within the 
area of infarction on the susceptibility sequences indicating the 
presence of more widespread blood products either related to laminar 
necrosis or prior hemorrhagic transformation. There is ex vacuo 
dilatation of the right lateral ventricle.  There is no 
hydrocephalus.  There is no mass, mass effect, midline shift or other 
focal parenchymal abnormality. There is no new intracranial 
hemorrhage.  There is no extra-axial collection. There are normal

Clinical History
70 Y/O MALE WITH EXTENSIVE PMH AND PROLONGED COURSE ON AC, NOW WITH 
UNEQUAL PUPILS, RIGHT-SIDED WEAKNESS 
 
 
Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex. 
 
Comparison
CT head from 11/30/2014  
 
Findings
Motion results in streak artifact and significant image degradation, 
limiting evaluation. Images through the middle and posterior cranial 
fossae are markedly degraded, severely limiting evaluation for acute 
intracranial abnormality.  
 
 
There is no definite CT evidence of acute transcortical infarction, 
intracranial hemorrhage, or extra-axial collection throughout the 
remainder of the brain parenchyma. There is no obvious mass effect or 
midline shift.  
Patchy foci of hypoattenuation within the periventricular and 
subcortical white matter without mass effect are most compatible with 
moderate microvascular ischemic changes given presence of 
atherosclerotic calcifications at the skullbase.  
 
The ventricles, cisterns and sulci are unchanged in size and 
configuration, with mild to moderate age related cerebral and 
cerebellar volume loss present. 
 
The calvarium is grossly intact. There is no significant disease in 
the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoids. 
 
Impression
No significant interval change since prior study, with no definite 
acute intracranial abnormality identified given marked limitations of 
the study. Diffusion-weighted MRI is significantly more sensitive for 
subtle ischemia.

Technique
 
CT perfusion: Before and during a contrast bolus injection, multiple 
5mm thick stacks of perfusion data were collected   .Following this, 
workstation technology was employed to create time of arrival, blood 
flow, mean transit time and blood volume color perfusion maps. 
 
CT angio of the neck: Following rapid IV bolus of contrast material, 
rapid helical imaging with very thin slices from the aortic arch to 
the lower cranial level was performed. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was utilized to create 3-D rendered MIP images.  NASCET 
methodology was employed to evaluate the degree of stenosis. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Following rapid injection of intravenous 
contrast material after an appropriate delay, very thin helical axial 
slices were obtained through the entire head. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was employed to create 3-D rendered and MIP images.

Findings
 
CT perfusion: There is decreased blood volume in the right basal 
ganglia corresponding to areas of infarction on the prior MRI study. 
Decreased blood volume is also noted in the right frontal corona 
radiata where infarction was noted. There is questionable 
visualization of the small area of infarction in the right precentral 
gyrus where there appears to be focal decreased blood volume. Large 
perfusion deficits are noted in the right MCA territory on the blood 
flow and mean transit time maps. Delayed perfusion on the IR epidural 
is noted in the anterior right temporal lobe. 
 
CT angio of the neck: There is no evidence of any stenosis or 
occlusion of the right or left carotid and vertebral arteries. Both 
vertebral arteries are congenitally small.  
 
CT angiography of the head: There is occlusion of the right M1 middle 
cerebral artery segment immediately after its origin. There is 
leptomeningeal collateral flow to the right MCA territory.  The right 
MCA branches that are filling via leptomeningeal collaterals are 
lower in density than the left MCA branches. There is no collateral 
supply from the leptomeningeal branches on the right accounting for 
the infarction in the right basal ganglia.  
The basilar artery is relatively small.  There is significant 
contribution to the posterior cerebral arteries via a large posterior 
communicating arteries.  
There is no evidence of aneurysm, AVM or other vascular occlusive 
disease. 
Calcified extra-axial lesion in the left frontal lobe consistent with 
meningioma is again noted.  
 
Impression
 
CT perfusion: Abnormal study with extensive perfusion deficit in the 
right MCA territory but more limited area of decreased blood volume 
corresponding with areas of infarction noted on MRI. 
 
CT angio of the neck: No significant abnormality noted. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Complete occlusion of proximal right M1 
segment with leptomeningeal collateral circulation noted.

Comparison
CT head from 11/16/2014. Correlation is made to MRI from 11/13/2014.  
 
Findings
The patient is status post interval right frontotemporoparietal / 
pterional craniotomy with associated postsurgical changes, with a 
subcutaneous drainage catheter in place superficial to the craniotomy 
flap and mild pneumocephalus within the middle cranial fossa and over 
the right cerebral convexity contained within a mildly hyperdense, 
thin extra-axial collection. There is a heterogeneous resection 
cavity containing fluid, air and blood products extending from the 
lateral right frontal lobe inferiorly into the anterior middle 
cranial fossa, where an air-fluid level is noted. There are acute 
blood products within the right frontal lobe, measuring up to 1.8 x 
1.5 centimeters. Medial to the resection cavity, there is 
hyperdensity which may reflect postsurgical change versus residual 
neoplasm. Comparison a operative study, there is decreasing 
surrounding hypoattenuation and mass-effect with decreasing midline 
shift, now measuring 8 millimeters (previously 1.1 centimeters). 
There is mild mass effect on the pons and right midbrain by the right 
uncus, compatible with uncal herniation. There is no tonsillar 
herniation. The right aspect of the suprasellar cistern is effaced. 
There continues to be significant impingement of the right lateral 
ventricle, with mild dilatation of the contralateral lateral 
ventricle. The remainder of the ventricular system is not enlarged.  
And mastoid air cells are clear.  There is fluid layering within the 
nasopharynx.  The visualized orbits are unremarkable.

prior MRI. The anterior tip of the right temporal lobe has also been 
resected. There are 2 small foci of abnormal contrast enhancement 
seen along the lateral aspect of the surgical bed (series 18, image 
63), favored to represent residual malignancy.  
 
There are extensive postsurgical changes including the following: 
There is a large T2 hyperintense fluid collection within the middle 
cranial fossa with peripheral restricted diffusion and T1 
hyperintensity consistent with seroma and retracting clot. There is 
diffuse FLAIR hyperintensity within the parenchyma surrounding the 
surgical bed consistent with vasogenic edema, with associated mass 
effect including effacement of the surrounding sulci and right 
lateral ventricle as well as 0.8 cm right to left midline shift at 
the level of the foramen of Monro.  There is a focal region of T2 
hyperintensity within the region of the right corona radiata 
measuring 1.4 cm, consistent with small seroma. There is a 1.3 x 3.0 
cm region of restricted diffusion in the posterolateral aspect of the 
right temporal lobe (series 4, image 13) without associated contrast 
enhancement, favored to represent region of cytotoxic edema, likely 
secondary to surgical retraction. There has been interval improvement 
in pneumocephalus on comparison with CT from the same date.  
 
The pituitary gland is normal in size. Normal flow void is noted in 
the major arteries of the circle of Willis. There is no significant 
disease in the paranasal sinuses. The orbits are grossly 
unremarkable. 
 
Impression

     1. Status post internal right frontotemporoparietal craniotomy 
with resection of the previously seen large parenchymal mass as well 
as the anterior tip of the right temporal lobe.  There are extensive 
postsurgical changes including large postsurgical seroma in the 
middle cranial fossa, mass-effect on the adjacent sulci and right 
lateral ventricle, as well as 0.8 cm right to left midline shift. 
     2. There are 2 small foci of abnormal contrast enhancement 
within the lateral aspect of the surgical bed which are highly 
concerning for residual malignancy.  Recommend correlation with 
pathological report of surgical margins.

 Redemonstrated is a right frontotemporoparietal / pterional 
craniotomy with resolving associated postsurgical changes, with a 
subcutaneous drainage catheter in place superficial to the craniotomy 
flap and diminishing pneumocephalus within the middle cranial fossa 
and over the right cerebral convexity contained within a mildly 
hyperdense, minimal extra-axial collection. Again seen is a 
heterogeneous resection cavity containing fluid, air and blood 
products extending from the lateral right frontal lobe inferiorly 
into the anterior middle cranial fossa, where an air-fluid level is 
noted. Evolving postoperative hemorrhage is noted within the inferior 
lateral frontal lobe and medial aspect of the temporal lobe. 
There is been an interval development of extensive right MCA 
territory infarction involving the frontal temporoparietal region and 
basal ganglia with extension into the thalamus and along the 
corticospinal tract. Within the area of infarction, there are 
numerous areas of hyperdensity, corresponding to the subarachnoid 
hemorrhage seen on the prior study. There is marked associated mass 
effect and edema, with near complete effacement of the right lateral 
ventricle with only the right frontal horn and occipital horn 
minimally seen. The left lateral ventricle demonstrates interval 
increase in size, now moderately enlarged, with concern for trapping. 
There has been a marked interval increase in leftward midline shift, 
measuring approximately 1.3 centimeters (previously 7 millimeters). 
There is partial effacement of the superior and right aspect of the 
suprasellar cistern.  There is increasing right-sided uncal 
herniation.  
The mastoid air cells are clear.  There is fluid layering within the 
nasopharynx.  The visualized orbits are unremarkable.

Findings
The patient is status post interval right frontotemporoparietal 
craniectomy with associated postsurgical changes, and mild protrusion 
of the brain parenchyma through the defect. A drainage catheter is 
seen within hyperdense heterogeneous 1.4 centimeter thick collection 
containing foci of air superficial to the brain parenchyma. Hyper 
densities at the lateral aspect of the temporal lobe are noted, 
likely representing surgical material. Mild pneumocephalus is noted 
over the right cerebral convexity and within the right sylvian 
fissure.  
 
Again seen is a heterogeneous resection cavity containing fluid, air 
and blood products extending from the lateral right frontal lobe 
inferiorly into the anterior and medial temporal lobe, where an 
air-fluid level is noted. Evolving postoperative hemorrhage is noted 
within the inferior lateral frontal lobe and medial aspect of the

infarction involving the frontal temporoparietal regions and basal 
ganglia, extending into the thalamus and along the right cortical 
spinal tract. Within the area of infarction, there are numerous areas 
of hyperdensity, corresponding to the subarachnoid hemorrhage seen on 
the prior study. There is marked associated edema with sulcal 
effacement, however there is decreased effacement of the right 
lateral ventricle, which now appears slit-like (although the temporal 
horn still appears completely effaced), with decreased midline shift 
which measures approximately 7 millimeters (previously 1.3 
centimeters). There is likewise greater patency of the 3rd ventricle 
and slightly diminished size of the left lateral ventricle. There is 
decreased although persistent right-sided uncal herniation. Mild 
effacement of the right aspect of the suprasellar cistern is again 
seen.  There is no tonsillar herniation.  
 
The mastoid air cells are clear.  There is fluid layering within the 
nasopharynx. There is minimal mucosal thickening within the ethmoid 
air cells. The visualized orbits are unremarkable.

well as a punctate chronic appearing lacunar infarct within the right 
cerebellar hemisphere.  
 
 
No mass effect or midline shift.  
No definite extra-axial collection or intracranial hemorrhage.  
Questionable hyper density at the bilateral inferior frontal lobes 
seen on the CT appears to have a linear distribution is therefore 
favored to represent streak artifact rather than contusions.

PROCESSING  
 
Clinical History
Incidentally found stroke in the left occipital region. 
 
Technique
Noncontrast CT head: Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the 
skull base to the vertex without contrast. 
 
CT angio of the neck: Following rapid IV bolus of contrast material, 
rapid helical imaging with very thin slices from the aortic arch to 
the lower cranial level was performed. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was utilized to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
NASCET methodology was employed to evaluate the degree of stenosis. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Following rapid injection of intravenous 
contrast material after an appropriate delay, very thin helical axial 
slices were obtained through the entire head. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was employed to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
 
Contrast
100 cc of Ultravist 350 intravenous.

dilatation of the right occipital horn. No acute intracranial 
hemorrhage or compelling evidence for acute transcortical infarction 
is identified. Again noted are areas of low attenuation in the 
periventricular and subcortical white matter, a nonspecific finding 
however most likely secondary to chronic small vessel ischemic 
disease. There are prominent atherosclerotic calcifications of the 
supra cavernous portion of the bilateral internal carotid arteries, 
and intracranial portion of the bilateral vertebral arteries. No 
extra-axial collection or midline shift. Involutional changes are 
noted. No hydrocephalus. The bony calvarium is intact. There is 
mucosal thickening within the bilateral ethmoid and maxillary 
sinuses.  The bilateral mastoid air cells are clear.  
 
Impression

     1. No evidence of acute transcortical infarction; however, if 
there is clinical suspicion of an acute infarction then consider

History and Indication
PREMATURE TWIN GESTATION, VSD.  
 
Technique
A multi sequential, multiplanar MRI of the brain was performed prior 
to and following intravenous administration of 1.9 mL of Gadavist 
contrast.  
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent GADAVIST 1.9 milliliters 01/19/2015 INTRAVENOUS 
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
There is no area of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction.  

 
There are multiple punctate foci of signal abnormality within the 
deep white matter of both frontoparietal lobes, most prominent in the 
frontal lobes, adjacent to the body and frontal horns of both lateral 
ventricles. These are mildly T2/FLAIR hyperintense and T1 hypointense 
in comparison to the adjacent white matter. They are similar in 
signal to the gray matter. These do not appear to contact the surface 
of the lateral ventricles, making periventricular leukomalacia 
unlikely.  
 
The brain parenchyma demonstrates a normal pattern of gyration. There 
is no abnormal intracranial enhancement. No enhancing intra-axial or 
extra-axial mass lesions. There is no mass effect, midline shift or 
hydrocephalus. There is no intraparenchymal susceptibility artifact 
to suggest hemosiderin or calcification.  
 
The cavernous sinuses enhance symmetrically without bulge.  Pituitary 
stalk is midline.  Sella turcica is unremarkable.  There is no 
suprasellar mass.  Fat is maintained in the superior orbital 
fissures. Visualized intraorbital contents are unremarkable.  
 
Flow voids in the central arteries of the circle of Willis are 
present.  
 
There is near-complete opacification of the maxillary sinuses mucosal 
thickening. Partial opacification of the right mastoid air cells is 
also noted.  
 
Impression
Multiple punctate foci of signal abnormality in the deep white matter 
of both frontoparietal lobes, as described above.  These are 
nonspecific and may represent heterotopic gray matter. Alternative 
considerations include prior infectious processes or possibly radial 
migration bands.  
 
Paranasal sinus disease as above.

Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex without intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal 
reconstructions were obtained. 
 
Comparison
Head CT dated 11/03/2014.  
 
Findings
There is no evidence of acute transcortical infarct, acute 
intracranial hemorrhage, or extra-axial collection.  
 
There is moderate age-related cerebral and cerebellar volume loss, 
similar to the prior exam.  
 
The ventricular system is stable in size and configuration from the 
previous exam with persistent moderate to severe ventriculomegaly. 
The degree of ventriculomegaly is more than expected for the degree 
of volume loss, with rounding of the frontal horns, prominence of the 
temporal horns and bowing of the corpus callosum. These findings have 
been described in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus.  
 
There are extensive confluent areas of low attenuation within the 
deep and subcortical white matter, unchanged from the prior exam, 
compatible with moderate to severe chronic small vessel ischemia.  
There are extensive vascular calcifications in the intracranial 
vertebral and internal carotid arteries.  
 
There is no mass effect or midline shift.  
 
There is subgaleal hematoma and edema overlying the posterior 
calvarium towards the vertex. No evidence of acute skull fracture.  
 
There is mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells, 
bilaterally.  
 
There is hypoaeration of the mastoid air cells, right more than left.  
There is fluid in both middle ear canals extending into the aditus ad 
antrum on the left. Opacification of left middle ear canal is new 
since the prior exam. These findings are nonspecific, please 
correlate with direct visualization the middle ear cavities and 
nasopharynx. There is a defect in the right tegmen tympani, 
unchanged.  
 
Impression

     1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, acute 
territorial infarct or skull fracture. 
     2. Moderate to severe chronic small vessel ischemic changes, 
similar to the prior exam. 
     3. Unchanged ventriculomegaly superimposed on age-related volume 
loss. Please correlate clinically for normal pressure hydrocephalus. 
     4. Opacification of the middle ear canals and mastoid air cells 
likely secondary to otomastoiditis. New opacification of the left 
middle ear cavity. Please correlate clinically with direct 
visualization.

Again noted is hyperdense hemorrhage in the right parietal lobe with 
a prominent area of abnormal hypodensity seen medial and posterior to 
this hemorrhage. There is reduced mass effect on the right lateral 
ventricle with partial re-expansion of the right trigone and interval 
enlargement of the right temporal horn. The previously noted 
hypodense subdural collection along the posterior falx and extending 
along the posterior aspect of the right parietal lobe has almost 
completely resolved, with a tiny amount remaining along the right 
lateral margin of the superior sagittal sinus. There is a thin rim of 
contrast enhancement surrounding the hypodense portion of this lesion 
which is nonspecific.  
A left frontal burr hole is again noted.  
 
The ventricles are within normal limits in size for age without 
evidence of hydrocephalus.   
 
There is a 2 mm subfalcine shift to the left.  
 
No other abnormal contrast enhancing lesion is noted.  
 
 
There is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses

Impression
Decreased mass effect associated with the partially hemorrhagic and 
partially hyperdense lesion in the right parietal lobe. The contrast 
enhancing rim around the hypodense area is completely nonspecific.  
Rim enhancement can be seen surrounding any pathology in the subacute 
stage.

Comparison
Prior CT study dated 01/01/2015. 
 
Findings
The patient is status post right-sided craniectomy. There is stable 
thickening of the dura overlying the calvarial defect. There is 
stable herniation of portions of the right cerebral hemisphere 
through the craniectomy defect. There is a hypodense extra-axial 
collection between the brain parenchyma and the thickened dura 
underlying the calvarial defect measuring approximately 2 cm which 
appears increased in size when compared to the prior study. Again 
seen are areas of hemorrhage involving the right frontal, right 
parietal, right occipital, and right temporal lobes.  These areas of 
hemorrhage appear less conspicuous when compared to the prior study 
likely representing further evolution /resolution. Again seen is a 
large amount of vasogenic edema surrounding the areas of hemorrhage 
which appears grossly stable when compared to the prior study. There 
is grossly stable mass effect with associated midline shift to the 
left which is also stable.  
 
There is a grossly stable left-sided hypodense subdural collection 
with stable mass effect upon the underlying brain parenchyma.  There 
is a stable hypodense subdural collection within the right frontal 
region with some mass effect upon the underlying brain parenchyma. 
Again seen is a mixed density extra-axial collection tracking from 
the posterior interhemispheric fissure along the right tentorial leaf 
which demonstrates less acute components likely representing further 
evolution. The size of the collection appears grossly unchanged.  
 
The post contrast imaging demonstrates enhancement of the thickened 
dura. It also demonstrates some linear enhancement possibly along the 
margins of the resection cavity in the right parietal region.  
 
The ventricular system is unchanged in size and configuration.  There 
is no hydrocephalus.  There are multiple vascular calcifications. The 
basal cisterns are patent.  
 
There is a burr hole within the left frontal bone.  
 
There is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses 
and mastoids. 
 
 
Impression
1. Some linear enhancement within the right parietal region which may 
be along the margins of the resection cavity.  It is unclear whether 
this represents infection versus postsurgical changes or even 
enhancement along the margins of hemorrhage.  Correlate clinically 
and with CSF analysis as warranted.  
2. Evolving/resolving hemorrhage involving the right cerebral 
hemisphere.  Stable vasogenic edema, mass effect, midline shift to 
the left.  
3. Enlarging extra-axial hypodense collection in the region of the 
calvarial defect between the thickened dura and the brain parenchyma.

History and Indication
HEADACHE WITH VP SHUNT 
 
 
Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex without intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal 
reconstructions were obtained. 
 
Comparison
Head CT dated 07/01/2013.  
 
Findings
There is a right frontal approach ventricular shunt catheter coursing 
through the right frontal horn of the lateral ventricle with the tip 
at the level of the foramen of Monro, unchanged from prior. The 
visualized extracranial portions of the shunt catheter are contiguous 
without kinking and no surrounding fluid collections. There is stable 
the size and configuration of the ventricular system, with severe 
dysmorphic enlargement of the lateral ventricles, especially on the 
left side. These may be the sequela of periventricular leukomalacia. 
There is an unchanged porencephalic cyst at the right frontal lobe. 
The third and fourth ventricles are enlarged with widening of the 
foramen of Luschka. There is significant cortical thinning of the 
parietal and occipital lobes bilaterally. The sella turcica is under 
developed.  Rounded soft tissue attenuation in this underdeveloped 
sella is also unchanged from the prior exam, likely representing the 
pituitary gland.  
 
There is no evidence of acute transcortical infarction or acute 
intracranial hemorrhage.  There is no mass effect or midline shift.  
 
The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. No 
evidence of acute skull fracture.  
 
 
 
Impression
No significant interval change from 07/01/2013. Grossly stable right 
frontal approach ventricular shunt catheter with stable size and 
configuration ventricular system, as described above.

History and Indication
S/P CRANI EXCISION OF LESION 
 
 
Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex. 
 
Comparison
Prior CT from 12/29/2014 and MRI from 12/26/2014 reviewed.  
 
Findings
There has been interval right frontal and temporal craniotomy. There 
has been interval resection of the previously seen enhancing mass 
seen in the right middle cranial fossa which arose from the clinoid 
process and tentorium.  
 
There is postoperative pneumocephalus and blood products in the 
resection cavity, the right extra-axial space, and left extra-axial 
space subjacent to the frontal bone. There is a small left frontal 
extra-axial collection of layering low attenuation fluid.  
 
There is postoperative subarachnoid hemorrhage in the resection 
cavity which is predominantly within the right aspect of the 
suprasellar cistern extending along the sylvian cistern and tracking 
into the right extra-axial space of the right middle cranial fossa. 
Although the hemorrhage is mostly ill-defined, the most focal region 
of extra-axial blood is best seen on image 14, series 4, where it 
measured 2.1 x 2.6 x 2.0 cm (AP x TR x CC).  
 
Again seen is some hyperdensity in the dorsal midbrain, best seen on 
image 29 series 301 which is stable when compared to the prior CT 
angiography.  
 
There is persistent mass effect with right-to-left midline shift 
focally at the level of the lesion with bowing of the 3rd ventricle. 
This is decreased from the prior study.  
 
There is asymmetric enlargement of the right temporal horn, 
unchanged. There is no evidence for hydrocephalus.  
 
There is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses 
and mastoids. Persistent midline shift at the level of the lesion 
with bowing of the 3rd ventricle.  The degree of shift is decreased 
from the prior study.  
 
There is a ground-glass haziness to the diploic space as well as the 
clivus.   
 
Impression
Interval right frontal craniotomy with resection of the extra-axial 
mass in the right medial middle cranial fossa region, which 
previously was noted to be arising from the clinoid process and 
tentorial leaf with associated postoperative change consisting of 
hemorrhage, extra-axial hematoma, and pneumocephalus which is noted 
at the resection site and along the bifrontal convexities as 
described. The degree of mass effect is slightly decreased from prior 
study.   
 
Ground-glass haziness to the diploic space as well as the clivus 
which may be secondary to chronic anemia or thalassemia. Correlate 
clinically.  
 
Again seen is some hyperdensity in the dorsal midbrain, best seen on 
image 29 series 301 which is stable to the prior CT angiography. 
Findings are most compatible with a cavernoma.

Findings
There is no area of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction.  

There is no interval change in the extent of demyelinating disease.  
There is no contrast-enhancing lesion and no new nonenhancing lesion 
noted. The lesion at the anterior aspect of the right temporal horn 
which was acute on the prior study is now somewhat smaller. Again 
seen is numerous supratentorial white matter lesions with numerous 
periventricular lesions with Dawson's fingers.  There are several 
juxta cortical lesions. There is a lesion in the splenium of the 
corpus callosum. Lesions are again noted in the pons, left brachium 
pontis and all left cerebellar white matter. 
Fluid lateral ventricles are mildly prominent. The 3rd and 4th 
ventricles are normal in size. There is mild cerebral cortical 
atrophy unchanged from the prior study and advanced for the patient's 
stated age. There is no significant atrophy of the corpus callosum or 
cerebellum.  
There is no mass effect, midline shift or other focal parenchymal 
abnormality.   
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. No 
abnormal contrast enhancement is noted in the brain or leptomeninges. 
The pituitary gland is small with a partially empty sella turcica. 
Normal flow void is noted in the major arteries of the circle of 
Willis.  
There is decrease in the mucosal disease in the sphenoid sinus with 
mild residual. There is no other disease in the paranasal sinuses. 
The orbits are grossly unremarkable. 
 
Impression
Multiple sclerosis with no evidence of new lesions. The single acute 
lesion from the prior study is now smaller.

Findings
The ventricles, sulci, and fissures are prominent consistent with 
age. There is moderate subcortical, periventricular, and deep white 
matter hypodensity consistent with chronic microvascular disease.  
Small well-defined foci of white matter hypodensity in the right 
corona radiata, right thalamus, left basal ganglia, and left frontal 
subcortical white matter may represent age indeterminate infarcts. 
There is no evidence for intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial 
collection.  There is mild to moderate cerebellar atrophy.  
 
There are extensive atherosclerotic calcifications seen in the 
visualized intracranial carotid and vertebral arteries. The 
visualized orbits and soft tissues are normal. The visualized 
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  
 
 
Impression
Multiple small foci of white matter hypodensity seen in the bilateral 
hemispheric white matter and basal ganglia may represent age 
indeterminate infarcts, MRI may offer more sensitive evaluation for 
detection of an acute infarct.  
Moderate chronic microvascular disease with age related volume loss.

Comparison
No prior studies are available for comparison.   
 
Findings
   
There is no  occlusive disease, aneurysm or AVM noted.   
 
The superior sagittal sinus is patent.  There is an arachnoid 
granulation involving the superior sagittal sinus. Evaluation of the 
proximal transverse sinuses is limited on the cut-out imaging but 
there are good flow voids on the non contrast imaging of the brain.

Technique
Multiple sequences were obtained through the brain without and with 
intravenous gadolinium. 
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent GADAVIST 2 milliliters 01/15/2015 INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
There is no area of abnormal restricted diffusion to suggest acute 
infarction. 
 
There are multiple subcortical ill-defined foci of increased signal 
intensity on the FLAIR sequences within both cerebral hemispheres, 
most pronounced within the right parietal, left frontal and left 
posterior temporal lobes which do not enhance on the post-contrast 
images likely representing nonenhancing subcortical tubers. These 
findings have remained unchanged in size and appearance in comparison 
with the study. Again noted is a partially calcified tuber within the 
left frontal lobe which demonstrates faint enhancement which has 
remained stable in comparison to study. There is enhanced subcortical 
tuber and within the right parietal lobe best demonstrated on image 
123 on series 13 and image 115 on series 101. This did not enhance on 
the post-contrast images on the previous study, however, this was 
present on the prior FLAIR images from the prior study (image 79 on 
series 101). This lesion has remained stable in size in comparison to 
the study.  
 
Again noted are multiple subependymal nodules involving both lateral 
ventricles. 1 of the subependymal nodules involving the lining of the 
body of the right lateral ventricle demonstrates homogeneous 
enhancement (image 100 and 6 on series 13).  Another of the 
subependymal nodules within the frontal horn right lateral ventricle 
demonstrate homogeneous enhancement best demonstrated on image 96 on 
series 13.  None of the other subependymal nodules demonstrate any 
enhancement on the postcontrast images.  
 
The ventricles and sulci are normal. There is no mass effect or 
midline shift. There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial 
collection.  
 
The pituitary gland is normal in size. 
 
Normal flow void is noted in the major arteries of the circle of 
Willis.  
 
Diffuse mucosal thickening is noted again noted within the bilateral 
maxillary and ethmoid sinuses.  
 
The orbits are grossly unremarkable. 
 
 
 
Impression
Stigmata of tuberous sclerosis are again noted. There is a new 
enhancing lesion involving the right parietal lobe. The other 
subcortical tubers as well as the subependymal nodules have remained 
unchanged in size and appearance.

Multiple sequences were obtained through the brain without and with 
intravenous gadolinium.  
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent GADAVIST 7.6 milliliters 01/05/2015 INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
Comparison
Prior study from February 9, 2012.  
 
Findings
No evidence acute infarcts, intracranial hemorrhage, or extra-axial 
collection.  
 
The patient is status post left frontal craniectomy.  There is 
encephalomalacia with gliosis involving the left anterior temporal 
lobe, with and ex vacuo dilatation of the temporal horn of the left 
lateral ventricle.  
 
There remains a irregularly shaped focus of soft tissue enhancement 
involving the left pterygopalatine and infratemporal fossa, involving 
the medial and lateral pterygoid muscles, extending into the left 
cavernous sinus and medial portion of the left middle cranial fossa. 
There is expansion of the foramen ovale suggesting a component of 
perineural spread along V3. There is restricted diffusion within this 
tumor mass.  
 
There is new opacification of the left mastoid air cells, with a 9 mm 
ring-enhancing focus seen on series 901 image 20. This may be due to 
mass-effect on the left eustachian tube.  
 
Normal flow void is noted in the major arteries of the circle of 
Willis. Small-vessel disease again noted. Moderate involutional 
changes. No other abnormality involving the brain parenchyma.  
 
Impression

     1. New opacification of the left mastoid air cells, which may be 
due to mass effect on the left eustachian tube by the left 
infratemporal mass. There is a 9 mm ring-enhancing focus seen within 
the left mastoid, which is nonspecific, clinical correlation for 
signs of mastoiditis is suggested. This is unlikely to represent 
tumor spread. 
     2. Otherwise no interval change within the enhancing soft tissue 
involving the left infratemporal fossa as described above suggestive 
of residual /recurrent tumor.

Findings
There has been interval revision of a right parietal approach 
ventricular shunt catheter, with the tip projecting into the trigone 
of the right lateral ventricle. Streak artifact from the VP shunt 
somewhat limits evaluation of the surrounding parenchyma. There is 
post surgical edema and air in the soft tissues overlying the right 
parietal calvarium. Postsurgical air is present within the frontal 
horn and temporal horn of the right lateral ventricle. There has been 
mild interval decompression of the lateral and 3rd ventricles. The 
4th ventricle is diminutive. Asymmetric fullness of the left lateral 
ventricle, with ballooning of the left temporal horn, is somewhat 
improved from the prior exam.  The visualized extracranial portions 
of the shunt catheter are contiguous without kinking.  
 
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute 
transcortical infarction. There is no significant mass effect or 
midline shift. Unchanged low lying cerebellar tonsils are compatible 
with patient's known Chiari 1 malformation.  
 
There is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses

Dysarthria.  
 
 
History and Indication
Dysarthria.  
 
Technique
A limited MRI of the brain was performed with only diffusion weighted 
imaging and FLAIR sequences obtained in the axial planes.  
 
Comparison
No prior MRI brain available for comparison. 
 
Correlation is made with the head CT dated 11/28/2014.  
 
Findings
This is an incomplete MRI of the brain with only axial 
diffusion-weighted and FLAIR sequences obtained.  
 
There are multiple scattered foci of restricted diffusion with 
corresponding hyperintense FLAIR signal, located within the corona 
radiata and centrum semiovale of both frontal lobes. There are also 
two take foci adjacent to the right frontal horn and three punctate 
foci of restricted diffusion in the left temporal lobe, adjacent to 
the left lateral ventricle.  
 
There is an area of heterogeneous FLAIR signal in the right occipital 
lobe with central low FLAIR and DWI/ADC signal and peripheral rim of 
hyperintense FLAIR signal with corresponding T2 shine through on DWI 
images. This most likely represents blood products, probably 
subacute.  
 
There is no significant mass effect.  There is no midline shift.  
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus.  
 
There are severe extensive confluent and patchy foci of hyperintense 
FLAIR signal within the deep and subcortical white matter and patchy 
foci of FLAIR signal scattered throughout bilateral gangliocapsular 
regions, pons and middle cerebral peduncles. These are most 
compatible with the sequela of chronic small vessel ischemia.  
 
 
Impression
1.  Multiple small scattered acute infarcts in the deep white matter, 
as described above.  These are most likely embolic.  
 
2.  Additional area of heterogeneous FLAIR signal in the right 
occipital lobe, as described above, which most likely represents 
subacute blood products.  
 
3.  No significant mass effect.  No midline shift or hydrocephalus.  
 
4.  Severe chronic small vessel ischemic changes.  
 
Findings were discussed with Dr. Tank at 10 a.m. on 11/29/2014.

Comparison
Head CT dated 11/28/2014.  
 
Findings
There is confluent and patchy low attenuation in the deep and 
subcortical white matter, bilaterally within the supratentorial 
parenchyma. Some of these foci correspond with acute infarcts in the 
deep white matter, which are seen to better advantage on the recent 
MRI brain performed earlier the same day. Otherwise, the low 
attenuation corresponds with chronic small vessel ischemic changes. 
There is also an area of heterogeneous area of relative hyper 
attenuation within the white matter of the right occipital lobe, 
which likely represents subacute blood products. Area of low 
attenuation surrounding this region likely represents edema.  There 
is no significant mass effect.  There is no midline shift.  There is 
no hydrocephalus. There is no focal extra-axial collection.  
 
Bony calvarium is grossly intact.  Visualized paranasal sinuses and 
mastoid air cells are clear. There is no significant mass effect or 
midline shift.  No evidence of hydrocephalus.

hemorrhagic transformation. There is no midline shift or 
hydrocephalus.  
 
There is a chronic infarct in the inferior left occipital lobe.  
There are generalized age-related involutional changes.  There is 
confluent and patchy low attenuation within the deep and subcortical 
white matter and ganglocapsular regions, with scattered chronic 
lacunar infarcts in the left caudate head, left lentiform nucleus, 
right frontal centrum semiovale and left cerebellum.  These are the 
sequela of moderate to severe chronic small vessel ischemia. There 
are moderate calcifications along both internal carotid arteries 
segments and both intracranial vertebral arteries.  
 
Bony calvarium is grossly intact.  Mastoid air cells are clear.  
There using small fluid level in the left sphenoid sinus. Partially

Technique
Multiplanar, multisequential non contrast MRI examination of the 
brain.  
 
Comparison
MRI of brain from 05/01/2014.  Correlation is made to head CT from 
earlier today.  
 
Findings
Images are markedly degraded by motion artifact, limiting evaluation. 
Additionally, there is significant blooming related to the right 
parietal shunt catheter and port. 
 
There is a punctate focus of diffusion/FLAIR hyperintensity within 
the right cerebral peduncle (series 2, image 40) without definite 
corresponding ADC abnormality, however evaluation is limited 
considering marked motion artifact. The focus of diffusion 
hyperintensity within the posterior limb of the right internal 
capsule shows ADC hyperintensity and T2 shine through and was present 
on the prior examination. There is no acute territorial infarction.  
 
Evaluated to better advantage on the head CT, a right parietal 
approach ventricular shunt catheter is in place. The ventricles are 
stable in size and configuration, remaining moderately enlarged.  
There is moderate age related cerebral and cerebellar volume loss. 
There is scattered areas of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity within the 
bihemispheric subcortical and periventricular white matter, most 
compatible with at least moderate microvascular ischemic disease. 
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection.  
The mastoid air cells are clear. There is no significant mucosal 
thickening within the paranasal sinuses. Evaluation of the orbits and 
skull base is markedly limited.  
 
Impression
Markedly limited study secondary to motion artifact. No acute 
territorial infarction. Possible punctate subacute infarct within the 
right cerebral peduncle. Other findings as above.

Technique
A multisequential, multiplanar MRI of the brain was performed without

01/07/2015 MRA brain.  
 
Findings
This is a limited MRI of the brain performed with only axial 
diffusion-weighted and FLAIR sequences performed, per the ordering 
physician's request.  
 
There is a shunt catheter overlying the right parietal calvarium 
which results in artifact, markedly limiting evaluation of the 
underlying parenchyma in the right parietal and posterior temporal 
lobes. The remainder of the parenchyma demonstrates no evidence of 
restricted diffusion to suggest an acute infarct.  
 
There is no mass effect or midline shift.  
 
There are generalized age related involutional changes with secondary 
prominence of cortical sulci and ventricles. There is moderate 
enlargement of the lateral ventricles, which allowing for differences 
in technique is similar to 1/0 07/2015. There is moderate confluent 
hyperintense FLAIR signal in the periventricular white matter, corona 
radiata and centrum semiovale.  There additional patchy foci of FLAIR 
signal scattered within the deep and subcortical white matter, 
ganglial capsular regions, thalami and brainstem. These are similar 
to the prior exam and most compatible with chronic small vessel 
ischemic changes. There is a chronic lacunar infarct in the posterior 
limb of the right internal capsule.  Some of the hyperintense FLAIR 
signal in the right cerebral peduncle may reflect wallerian 
degeneration. There is also a punctate chronic lacunar infarct in the 
left frontal corona radiata.  
 
 
Impression
No significant interval change from 01/07/2015. Limited evaluation of 
the right parietal and right temporal lobe secondary to ventricular 
shunt catheter.  Otherwise no evidence of acute infarct. No mass 
effect or midline shift.  
 
Stable size and configuration of the ventricular system. 
 
Moderate chronic small vessel ischemic changes, as above.

Clinical History
Blurred vision.  
 
Technique
Multiple sequences were obtained through the brain without and with 
intravenous gadolinium.  cc of Magnevist was administered. 
 
Contrast
 
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
There is no area of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction.  

Multiple white matter FLAIR hyperintensities noted, likely mild small 
vessel disease.  
The ventricles are normal. 
No mass effect or midline shift.  
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. No 
abnormal contrast enhancement is noted in the brain or leptomeninges. 
 
There appears to be kinking of the right optic nerve in the orbit. 
However, no enhancement or other abnormality of the optic nerve 
sheath is seen. Cranial nerves appear otherwise unremarkable. Optic 
chiasm appears unremarkable.  
 
Normal flow void is noted in the major arteries of the circle of 
Willis.  
 
Moderate mucosal disease of the left frontal, severe bilateral 
ethmoid, complete opacification of the right sphenoid, mild disease 
of the left sphenoid, and moderate bilateral maxillary sinus disease 
with air-fluid levels on the right sinus. There are multiple 
retention cysts or polyps noted.  
 
Impression

     1. No acute infarct. 
     2. Kinking of the left optic nerve, without abnormal enhancement 
of the optic nerve sheath or other abnormality noted. This finding is 
nonspecific and of questionable clinical significance. Correlation 
with ophthalmologic exam and possibly a dedicated orbital MRI may be 
suggested. 
     3. Extensive sinus disease as above, with an air-fluid level 
right maxillary sinus, which may be seen in allergic rhinitis or 
acute sinusitis, to be correlated with symptoms.

Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex. Coronal and sagittal reformats were performed reviewed.  
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
While there is no definite CT evidence of acute transcortical 
infarction at this time, there is hyperdense vessel within the left 
sylvian fissure (series 2, image 27).  
There is periventricular and subcortical hypodensity within 
atherosclerotic calcification of the carotid artery siphons 
representing chronic microvascular ischemic change. There is a 
chronic appearing lacunar infarct in the right superior cerebellar 
hemisphere.  
 
Involutional changes involving the ventricles, sulci and cisterns.  
 
There is no mass effect or midline shift.  
 
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage or focal extra-axial 
collection. 
 
The calvarium is intact.  
 
There is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses 
and mastoids. 
 
Impression
Hyperdense vessel within the left sylvian fissure compatible with 
thrombus within an M2 segment of the MCA. Further evaluation with CTA 
is recommended.  
Chronic microvascular ischemic disease. Chronic appearing lacunar 
infarct in the right superior cerebellar hemisphere.

CTA head and neck with perfusion.  
 
Clinical History
Sudden onset aphasia. 
 
Technique
CT perfusion: During a contrast bolus injection, 16 5mm thick stacks 
of perfusion data were collected intracranially.Following this, 
workstation technology was employed to create blood flow, mean 
transit time and blood volume color perfusion maps. 
 
CT angio of the neck: Following rapid IV bolus of contrast material, 
rapid helical imaging with very thin slices from the aortic arch to 
the lower cranial level was performed. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was utilized to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
NASCET methodology was employed to evaluate the degree of stenosis. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Following rapid injection of intravenous 
contrast material after an appropriate delay, very thin helical axial 
slices were obtained through the entire head. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was employed to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent OMNIPAQUE 350 135 milliliters 12/26/2014 INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
Comparison
Non contrast CT head from earlier tonight  
 
Findings
CT perfusion: There is abnormal perfusion within left cerebral 
hemisphere with increased mean transit time and decreased blood flow, 
less prominent within the left frontal lobe. There is an area of 
decreased cerebral blood volume in the left temporoparietal region.  
 
CT angio of the neck: There is complete occlusion of the left 
internal carotid artery distal to the bifurcation, extending 
superiorly to the carotid terminus. The origins of the left and right 
carotid arteries are patent.  
There is atherosclerotic calcification at the bifurcation of the left 
and right carotid artery. The bilateral vertebral arteries are 
patent. The right vertebral artery is dominant.  
Of note, there is likely moderate to severe stenosis of the right 
vertebral artery at its origin, with mild to moderate stenosis on the 
contralateral side. There is diffuse irregularity of the extracranial 
and intracranial vasculature secondary to atherosclerotic disease.  
There is severe discogenic degenerative disease of the cervical spine 
with moderate to severe canal stenosis at C3-4, C5-6 and C6-7 and 
multilevel advanced neural foraminal narrowing. Nonspecific sclerotic 
lesion within the T2 vertebral body. 
 
CT angiography of the head: There is occlusion of a left M3 opercular 
branch of the middle cerebral artery within the left sylvian fissure 
(axial images 221-226). There is no evidence of aneurysm, AVM or 
vascular occlusive disease. The circle of Willis appears grossly 
patent through collateral flow through.  
 
Impression
CT perfusion: Abnormal perfusion involving the left cerebral 
hemisphere. Diminished cerebral blood volume within the left 
temporoparietal region is indicative of suspected infarct core, with 
surrounding large region of ischemic penumbra.  
 
CT angio of the neck: Complete occlusion of the left internal carotid 
artery distal to the bifurcation extending to the carotid terminus.  
Stenosis at the origins of the vertebral arteries, as above.  
 
CT angiography of the head: Occlusion of a left M3 opercular branch 
of the middle cerebral artery. There is reconstitution of the left 
anterior and middle cerebral arteries through collateral flow.  
 
Severe multilevel cervical discogenic degenerative disease.

hyperintensity that are diffusion restricting, consistent with 
central necrosis. There is moderate surrounding white matter T2 and 
FLAIR hyperintensity consistent with vasogenic edema. No other 
abnormal areas of abnormal focal parenchymal contrast enhancement are 
identified to suggest metastatic disease. There is mild mass effect 
on the adjacent gyri of the parietal lobe.  There is no midline

greatest dimension. This mass contains several small regions of 
necrosis. This finding is consistent with metastasis versus a primary 
malignant brain neoplasm with a broad differential. 
     2. Small volume subarachnoid hemorrhage within the right central 
sulcus.

Findings
There are multiple bilateral foci of increased restricted diffusion 
involving extreme capsule /subinsular white matter bilaterally, 
bilateral parahippocampal regions, hypothalamus and bilateral 
mamillary bodies, bonds, and peripheral aspect of the bilateral 
cerebellar hemispheres.  This is likely related to a multiple small 
acute infarcts. Ill-defined enhancement is suggested in association 
with external capsule/subinsular and parahippocampal infarcts. There 
is mild associated mass effect.  There is corresponding FLAIR signal 
hyperintensity in. Small punctate foci of susceptibility are noted in 
association with external capsule/subinsular and parahippocampal 
infarct consistent with petechial hemorrhages.  
 
There is no hydrocephalus.  There is no midline shift or evidence for 
transtentorial herniation. There are small nodular foci of signal 
abnormality alone ventricular surface of the lateral ventricles which 
follows the signal characteristics of gray matter on all the 
sequences and may represent foci of heterotopic gray matter. The 
midline structures are normal in position. The pituitary gland is 
unremarkable.  
 
There is no evidence of extra-axial collection. The major 
intracranial vascular structures demonstrate T2 flow voids.  
 
Extra-axial CSF intensity collection is noted in the posterior 
cranial fossa, posterior to the cerebellum with mild mass effect on 
the adjacent cerebellar hemisphere insonated present an arachnoid 
cyst.  
 
The orbits and visualized soft tissues are normal. There is extensive 
mucosal thickening in the visualized paranasal sinuses, correlate for 
sinusitis.

MRI brain without and with contrast.  
 
Clinical History
Seizures.  
 
History and Indication
Febrile seizures.  
 
Technique
 a multi sequential, multiplanar MRI of the brain was performed prior 
to and following the intravenous administration of 1.6 mL of Gadavist 
contrast, using the seizure protocol.  
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent GADAVIST 1.6 milliliters 01/19/2015 INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
Comparison
MRI brain dated 01/03/2015.  
 
Findings
Since the previous exam, there has been interval resolution of the 
previously described multiple foci of restricted diffusion compatible 
with evolving acute infarcts. There is no new area of restricted 
diffusion in the parenchyma to suggest an acute infarct. There is 
persistent hyperintense T2/FLAIR signal involving extreme capsule 
/subinsular white matter bilaterally, bilateral parahippocampal 
regions, hypothalamus and bilateral mamillary bodies, and brainstem. 
There has been interval resolution of the associated mild mass 
effect. The mammillary bodies and hypothalamus are significantly 
decreased in size from the prior exam. There is increased amorphous 
heterogeneous enhancement in the subinsular regions, bilaterally. 
Increased enhancement is also noted in bilateral medial temporal 
lobes and mammillary bodies. Enhancement may be seen with subacute 
infarctions. There is not much hyperintense FLAIR signal in the 
cerebellum. Scattered punctate foci of susceptibility corresponding 
to petechial blood products, are seen in association with infarcts 
involving bilateral external capsules/subinsular regions, medial 
temporal lobes and right cerebellum.  
 
Stable size and configuration of the ventricular system.  There is no 
hydrocephalus.  There is no significant mass effect.  There is no 
midline shift.  
 
There are small nodular foci of signal abnormality along the margins 
of the lateral ventricles, which follow the signal intensity of gray 
matter on all sequences, representing subependymal heterotopic gray 
matter.  These are unchanged from the prior exam.  
 
The sella turcica is unremarkable. There is no tonsillar herniation. 
Again redemonstrated is an extra-axial collection in the posterior 
fossa which follows CSF signal on all sequences, unchanged from the 
prior exam and most likely an arachnoid cyst.  
 
The flow voids in the central arteries of the circle of Willis are 
present. There is a fenestration of the right A1 segment and right P1 
segment. The supraclinoid right ICA elevates the pre chiasmatic right 
optic nerve, just proximal to the chiasm. The left vertebral artery 
is dominant.  
 
There is lobulated T2 hyperintense signal in the left paramedian body 
of the clivus, unchanged from the prior exam, which likely represents 
a developing sphenoid sinus.  
 
 
Impression
1. Multiple evolving subacute infarcts, as described above. No 
superimposed acute infarction since 01/03/2015. No significant mass 
effect. No hydrocephalus.  
 
2. Subependymal gray matter heterotopia along the lateral ventricles, 
unchanged from the prior exam.

Technique
Multiple sequences were performed through the brain in multiple

Comparison
MRI brain 11/10/2014.  
 
Findings
 There is no evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest acute 
infarction.  
 
There is moderate to severe dilatation of the bodies of the lateral 
ventricles as well as the frontal and temporal horns. The 3rd 
ventricle appears mildly dilated. The 4th ventricle appears to be 
within normal limits. There is some increased signal intensity 
involving the periventricular white matter which may represent 
transependymal flow of CSF versus white matter disease. There is 
additional FLAIR signal hyperintensity extending from the 
periventricular white matter adjacent to the frontal horns of both 
lateral ventricles to the subcortical white matter of both frontal 
lobes, most pronounced near vertex. There is also some mild ex vacuo 
dilatation of the frontal horns of both lateral ventricles along with 
a paucity of white matter within the bilateral frontal lobes. There 
is no associated mass effect.  This likely represents gliosis due to 
white matter disease of uncertain etiology.  There is moderate 
cerebral and cerebellar atrophy advanced for age. There are 
postoperative changes compatible with craniad abnormality involving 
the left parietal calvarium.  
 
There are stable chronic subdural collections within the bilateral 
frontal parietal convexities. There is no midline shift.  There is no 
transtentorial and downward herniation. There is no new parenchymal 
abnormality There is normal flow voids in the major arteries of the 
circle of Willis.  
 
The pituitary gland is normal in size.  
 
There is no significant disease in the paranasal sinuses.  
 
No gross abnormality is noted within the orbits.  
 
Impression

     1. Dilatation of both lateral ventricles and the 3rd ventricle, 
unchanged in comparison to the study. This may be related to a 
component of hydrocephalus exacerbated by compared to dilatation of 
ventricles due to cerebral atrophy. Clinical correlation is 
recommended.
     2. Moderate cerebral and cerebellar atrophy advanced for 
patient's age.  
     3. Stable bilateral subdural collections. 
     4. Increased signal intensity on the T2 and FLAIR sequences 
involving periventricular white matter which may represent 
transependymal flow of CSF versus chronic small-vessel disease with 
additional hyperintense signal on the T2 and FLAIR sequences 
extending from the periventricular white matter near the frontal 
horns of both lateral ventricles to the subcortical white matter of 
both frontal lobes likely representing evidence of white matter 
disease on the etiology. Clinical correlation is recommended. This is 
remained unchanged in comparison to previous study.

Comparison
CT head from 12/17/2014. Correlation is made to an MRI/MRA from 
12/17/2014.  
 
Findings
Redemonstrated is an evolving left hemi pontine infarction without 
evidence of hemorrhagic transformation. Lesion slightly deforms the 
pontine contour without resulting in significant mass effect. There 
is no midline shift or herniation pattern. No extra-axial collection 
is present.  
 
There is moderate age-related cerebral and cerebellar volume loss 
with ex vacuo ventricular prominence.  
Confluent areas of hypoattenuation within the periventricular and 
subcortical white matter without mass effect are most compatible with 
moderately severe microvascular ischemic changes given presence of 
atherosclerotic calcifications at the skullbase. There are multiple 
foci of lacunar infarction, most prominent within the right caudate 
head and corona radiata/ centrum semiovale bilaterally.  
 
 
The calvarium is intact. There is no significant disease in the

Clinical History
Infarction, EVALUATE FOR OCCULSION/STENOSIS 
 
 
 
 
Technique
3D time-of-flight for the arteries in the neck. Following this MIP 
images were created. NASCET methodology was employed to evaluate the 
degree of stenosis. 
 
Comparison
MRA head and neck from 12/17/2014  
 
Findings
MRA Head: 
Redemonstrated is a short segment of moderate to high-grade stenosis 
involving the intradural left vertebral artery in the region of the 
left PICA, best seen on the MRA of the neck. MRA head demonstrates 
lack of flow related enhancement of the proximal intradural left 
vertebral artery which likely reflects markedly reduced flow. There 
is moderate irregularity and mild-to-moderate stenosis of the basilar 
artery. There is a suspected 2 millimeter posterolaterally projecting 
a focal outpouching arising from the distal left MCA (series 1, image 
90).  
 
MRA Neck: 
There is approximately 50 percent stenosis of the right internal 
carotid artery just distal to the bifurcation. Mild associated 
eccentric concentric T1 hyperintensity is again noted.  
There is approximately 50 percent stenosis of the left internal 
carotid artery just distal bifurcation, with an additional area of 
flow related enhancement just posterior and medial to the major 
lumen. There is eccentric focal T1 hyperintensity in this region 
which may suggest a dissection (series 7, image 29).  
Mild less than 30 percent stenosis of the right vertebral artery at 
the level of C2-C3.  
Origins of the great vessels are not evaluated.  
 
Impression
Moderate to high-grade stenosis involving the intradural left 
vertebral artery without significant change from the prior study, 
which may reflect pseudo aneurysm/dissection.  
Bilateral proximal internal carotid artery stenosis with associated 
eccentric T1 hyperintensity bilaterally, more prominent on the left, 
is likewise unchanged; possible dissection is not excluded although 
the signal abnormality may represent atherosclerotic plaque.  
Possible distal left MCA and small aneurysm versus infundibulum.

infarcts noted within the right caudate head and left centrum 
semiovale.  
 
 
Redemonstrated is abnormal FLAIR signal at the periphery of the 
intradural left vertebral artery near the origin of the PICA, with 
corresponding flow void irregularity on the fluid weighted images. 
 
There is mild scattered mucosal thickening throughout the paranasal 
sinuses. There is extensive left mastoid air cell opacification.  
 
 
Impression
No significant interval change from the prior study demonstrating an 
evolving left hemipontine infarct and with eccentric wall signal 
abnormality of the intradural left vertebral artery, which may 
reflect a pseudoaneurysm/dissection.

An incompletely characterized 2.1 x 2.2 cm necrotic mass, with a 
hyperdense rim, is identified in the right parietal lobe with 
moderate surrounding vasogenic edema and local mass effect concerning 
for a metastatic lesion.  There is no midline shift.  
 
There is a hyperdense lesion within the posterior right globe likely 
metastasis.  
 
There is no loss of gray-white matter distinction or other sign of 
acute infarction. 
 
The ventricles, cisterns and sulci are age-appropriate in size. 
 
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. 
 
The calvarium is intact.  
 
There is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses 
and mastoids. 
 
Impression
Incompletely characterized mass measuring up to 2.2 cm in the right 
parietal lobe with surrounding vasogenic edema and local mass effect 
concerning for metastasis in this breast cancer patient. 
Hyperdense lesion within the posterior right lobe likely metastasis. 
 
Further evaluation is recommended with MRI or contrast-enhanced CT.  
 
Findings were discussed with Dr. Uppal By radiology resident, Dr.

Comparison
No prior MRI.  Prior CT head from earlier the same day.  
 
Findings
There is no area of abnormal restricted diffusion to suggest acute 
infarction.  
 
As seen on the previous CT, there is a 2.3 x 2.1 cm mass in the right 
parietal lobe with extensive surrounding vasogenic edema and local 
mass effect. This mass demonstrates rim enhancement most compatible 
with metastasis. There is also 7 mm homogeneously enhancing lesion 
seen in the right parietal lobe further inferiorly at the gray-white 
junction. In addition there is homogeneously enhancing 4 mm of the 
ventricular surface adjacent to the right splenium of corpus callosum 
consistent with metastasis.  
 
Additionally, there is slightly heterogeneously enhancing 1.5 x 1.2 
cm mass within the right posterior globe consistent with metastasis.  
 
Small DVA is noted within the medial left cerebellar hemisphere.  
 
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection.  
The pituitary gland is normal in size. 
Normal flow void is noted in the major arteries of the circle of 
Willis.  
There is no significant disease in the paranasal sinuses. 
 
Impression

     1. No evidence of acute stroke. 
     2. Multiple right-sided metastatic lesions as described above. 
     3. Enhancing lesion in the right posterior globe, likely 
representing a choroidal metastasis given the patient's history of 
breast cancer.

Technique
Multiple sequences were obtained through the brain without and with 
intravenous gadolinium. 
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent GADAVIST 9.5 milliliters 01/26/2015 INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
Comparison
Prior study dated 04/29/2014. 
 
Findings
There is no area of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction.  

Again seen is a large mass centered in the sella turcica to the right 
of midline with invasion of the right cavernous sinus which measures 
2.3 x 2.2 centimeters and the coronal plane (axial image 8) and 2.4 
centimeters in transverse diameter. The coronal dimensions of the 
lesion are slightly decreased in size when compared to prior study. 
The mass demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement with a cystic 
component measuring 8 mm anteriorly and decreased foci of T1 and T2 
hyperintensity compatible with resolving intra tumoral blood 
products. The pituitary stalk is deviated leftward. There is 
suprasellar extension of the mass to the right of midline which is 
compressing the optic chiasm and pre chiasmatic optic nerves on the 
right, slightly decreased from prior study. There is asymmetric 
decreased tissue volume in the right optic chiasm and optic tract. 
The right intracranial cavernous internal carotid artery remains 
patent without evidence of narrowing. 
 
The ventricles and sulci are stable in size and in configuration.  
There is no midline shift. There are scattered foci of 
periventricular and subcortical FLAIR hyperintensity most pronounced 
in the left temporal lobe, unchanged from prior study, most 
compatible with microvascular ischemic disease.  
There is no intraparenchymal hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. No 
abnormal contrast enhancement is noted in the brain or leptomeninges. 
 
 
Normal flow void is noted in the major arteries of the circle of 
Willis.  
 
Evaluation of the paranasal sinuses demonstrate a mucous retention 
cyst with inspissated secretions within the left maxillary sinus 
measuring 1.7 centimeters, unchanged. There is mild mucosal 
thickening in the bilateral frontal, ethmoid, and right maxillary 
sinus. 
 
The orbits are otherwise grossly unremarkable. 
 
Impression
Again seen is a large mass centered in the sella turcica with 
invasion of the right cavernous sinus and suprasellar extension with 
associated mass effect, slightly decreased in size and degree of mass 
effect when compared to prior study as described. No significant 
narrowing of the right cavernous internal carotid artery.  
 
No evidence of acute infarction or extra-axial hematoma. Mild 
microvascular ischemic disease most pronounced in the left temporal 
lobe, unchanged.

No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
There is no area of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction. 
Again noted are multiple demyelinating lesions throughout the 
bilateral cerebral white matter including multiple periventricular 
and juxtacortical white matter lesions consistent with the patient's 
diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. 1 of the hand demyelinating lesions 
involving the periventricular white matter adjacent to the anterior 
aspect of the body of the right lateral ventricle best demonstrated 
on the FLAIR axial image 78 (series 800) and on post contrast T1 
weighted axial images 115 (series 9) demonstrates an interval 
increase in size with some degree of enhancement. This is consistent 
with an enlarging active demyelinating lesion. There is a new 
periventricular demyelinating lesion located just posterior to the 
other enhancing lesion best demonstrated image 79 on series 100 and 
image 115 on series 9 which demonstrates peripheral enhancement. This 
is consistent with a new active demyelinating lesion. The other 
demyelinating lesions have remained stable in size and appearance 
given differences in technique. Mild atrophy of the corpus callosum 
is again noted with some demyelinating lesions involving the splenium 
and the body of the corpus callosum. Again noted is some tissue loss 
and gliosis within the left frontal cortex inferiorly representing 
sequelae of prior trauma. The ventricles and cisterns appear 
unremarkable. There is no mass effect or midline shift.  There is no 
intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. No abnormal 
contrast enhancement is noted in the brain or leptomeninges. 
 
The pituitary gland is normal in size. Normal flow void is noted in 
the major arteries of the circle of Willis.  There is no significant 
disease in the paranasal sinuses. The orbits are grossly 
unremarkable. 
 
 
 
Impression
Findings consistent with multiple sclerosis with interval development 
of a new enhancing demyelinating lesion in the right frontal lobe and 
involving the periventricular white matter adjacent to the right 
lateral ventricle. There has been interval enlargement of 1 of the 
other periventricular white-matter lesions adjacent to the right 
lateral ventricle within the right frontal lobe exam past the study. 
This lesion likewise demonstrate some enhancement.  The other 
demyelinating lesions have remained stable in size and appearance. .

 ,,,MRI:Brain W/wo Contrast,,"Addendum Begins

After further review, and after creation of new coronal images 
perpendicular to the plane of the temporal lobe, there is become 
clear that there is both atrophy and abnormal increased FLAIR signal 
in the superior portion of the left hippocampus posteriorly.  This is 
consistent with hippocampal sclerosis. Additionally, prior outside 
studies were reviewed which lack similar imaging and were therefore 
nondiagnostic. The sagittal FLAIR images show the prominent anterior 
posterior extent of the abnormal signal. Verbal report was given to 
Dr. Cropped regarding this finding and diagnosis.

Clinical History
MEMORY LOSS   UNSTEADY GAIT craniotomy for resection of a cavernous 
sinus hemangioma in 2012.  
 
 
Technique
Multiple sequences were obtained through the brain without and with 
intravenous gadolinium. 
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent GADAVIST 11 milliliters INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
Comparison
August 27, 2014 and September 17, 2013.  
 
Findings
There is no area of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction.  

 
Again noted is a right frontal temporal craniotomy with a CSF filled 
resection cavity in the right temporal region communicating with the 
temporal horn of the right lateral ventricle. Again seen is 
surrounding gliosis. There are areas of nodularity and septation 
within this resection cavity with possible new subcentimeter nodular 
enhancement (see image 56, series 9). Again seen is stable 
enhancement of the dura underlying the calvarial defect likely 
postsurgical in nature.  
 
The residual enhancing sellar and parasellar lesion measures 
approximately 2.6 x 1.5 cm in axial dimensions, which is similar in 
size compared to the most recent prior study allowing for differences 
and technique. The tumor again extends into the region of the right 
orbital apex and involves the right cavernous sinus. The tumor 
demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement which appears similar to the 
most recent prior study but there is less enhancement of the left 
aspect of the tumor compared to the study from 2013. At the left side 
of the sella turcica, the nonenhancing portion of tumor measures 
approximately 2.0 cm in height which is stable from the most recent 
prior study and enlarged from 2013. There is stable mass effect on 
the optic chiasm. The pituitary stalk is deviated to the left. The 
tumor again appears hyperintense on the FLAIR imaging and slightly 
hypointense on the T1 precontrast imaging. There is stable 
enhancement and nodularity along the right petroclival ligament.  
 
There is asymmetry between the rectus muscles and the superior 
ophthalmic veins involving the orbits with the right superior 
ophthalmic vein and right rectus muscles appearing smaller than the 
left. These findings are unchanged.  
 
There is no hydrocephalus.  
There is no mass effect or midline shift. There is a stable enhancing 
extra-axial 8 mm lesion within the region of the left sylvian fissure 
which may represent an incidental meningioma.  
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage.  
 
Normal flow void is noted in the major arteries of the circle of 
Willis.  
There is no significant disease in the paranasal sinuses. 
The orbits are grossly unremarkable. 
 
 
Impression
Stable appearance of the residual tumor in the sellar/parasellar 
region when compared to the most recent prior.  However, a portion of 
the tumor appears increased in size and demonstrates a change in 
enhancement characteristics when compared to the prior study from 
09/17/2013. 
 
New subcentimeter nodular enhancing focus within the resection cavity 
in the right temporal region. Continued follow up recommended.

There is evidence of resection of the previously seen probably cystic 
mass within the right cerebellum which previously demonstrated a 
peripheral enhancing nodule. Within the resection cavity, there is 
fluid and evidence for hemorrhage. On post-contrast imaging, there is 
enhancement involving the margins in the surgical bed within the 
right cerebellar hemisphere likely representing postoperative 
granulation tissue. There is significant residual vasogenic edema 
which exerts mass effect upon the 4th ventricle and the right 
quadrigeminal plate cistern as well as upon the adjacent sulci within 
the right cerebellar hemisphere. There is also some residual edema 
involving the medial aspect of the left cerebellar hemisphere. There 
is no evidence of hydrocephalus. There is no midline shift. The 
pituitary gland is normal in size. Normal flow void is noted in the 
major arteries of the circle of Willis.  There is a small mucocele in 
the right inferior maxillary sinus. The orbits are grossly 
unremarkable. 
 
Impression
Interval resection of the predominantly cystic right cerebellar mass. 
Evidence of hemorrhage within the resection cavity. Mild enhancement 
within the surgical bed likely representing postoperative changes.

CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST  
 
Clinical History
Aphasia and left hemiplegia. 
 
Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex without intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal 
reconstructions were obtained. 
 
Comparison
Outside head CT dated 03/07/2013.  
 
Findings
There is hyperdensity extending along the right MCA, involving the M1 
and superior M2 divisions.  This however does not appear 
significantly changed from 03/07/2013, and may reflect slow flow.  
There is no blurring of the gray-white matter interface to suggest 
acute transcortical infarct.  
 
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. There is 
similar loss of volume of the parenchyma with secondary prominence of 
the cortical sulci, cerebellar folia and ventricles.  The ventricular 
system is stable in size and configuration, without evidence of 
hydrocephalus.  
 
There is low attenuation in the periventricular white matter and 
patchy areas of low attenuation in the deep and subcortical white 
matter, overall similar to the prior exam, representing the sequela 
of chronic small vessel ischemia.  There is a chronic lacunar infarct 
in the left thalamus.  
 
The calvarium is intact. There is a partially empty sella turcica. 
Extensive calcifications are noted along both internal carotid artery 
siphons. No significant disease is noted in the paranasal sinuses or 
mastoids. 
 
Impression
1. No significant interval change from 03/07/2013 CT brain. No 
evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute transcortical 
infarction. Persistent hyperdensity extending along the right MCA, as 
above, not changed from the prior exam, may reflect slow flow. If 
there is continued clinical concern for acute infarction, then MRI or 
followup CT is recommended.

Clinical History
Left hemiplegia and aphasia.  
 
 
Technique
 
CT perfusion: Before and during a contrast bolus injection, multiple 
5mm thick stacks of perfusion data were collected   .Following this, 
workstation technology was employed to create time of arrival, blood 
flow, mean transit time and blood volume color perfusion maps. 
 
CT angio of the neck: Following rapid IV bolus of contrast material, 
rapid helical imaging with very thin slices from the aortic arch to 
the lower cranial level was performed. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was utilized to create 3-D rendered MIP images.  NASCET 
methodology was employed to evaluate the degree of stenosis. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Following rapid injection of intravenous 
contrast material after an appropriate delay, very thin helical axial 
slices were obtained through the entire head. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was employed to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
 
Contrast
140 mL of Ultravist 350 was administered intravenously.  
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison.  
 
Findings
CT perfusion: There is a large area of abnormal perfusion with 
increased mean transit time and decreased blood flow involving the 
entire right MCA territory. The cerebral blood volume in the right 
MCA territory is preserved.  These findings suggests at risk tissue 
with no definite core infarct. 
 
CT angio of the neck: The common carotid arteries are retropharyngeal 
at the level of C7 and T1. There is complete occlusion of the left 
ICA from its origin through its supraclinoid segment.  There is flow 
related enhancement within the left ACA and left MCA, via a patent 
anterior communicating artery. There is mild calcification at the 
right carotid bulb with no hemodynamically significant stenosis at 
the origin of the right ICA. Of the right vertebral artery is 
dominant. The left vertebral artery is hypoplastic and originates 
directly from the aortic arch. There is mild calcification with some 
narrowing at the origin of the left vertebral artery.  This is 
however difficult to assess given the small size of the vessel.  
 
CT angiography of the head: There is abrupt occlusion of the M1 
segment of the right MCA with relative paucity of flow peripherally 
in the M2 and M3 branches. However, there are likely some collaterals 
present, given the presence of flow in the M2 and M3 branches of the 
right MCA. There is calcification with mild narrowing of the 
cavernous and supraclinoid segment of the right ICA. There is 
reconstitution of flow within the left ACA and left MCA through a 
patent anterior communicating artery. There is fetal origin of the 
right PCA. There is no hemodynamically significant stenosis in the 
posterior circulation. There is no gross aneurysm or AVM in the 
circle of Willis.  
 
There is questionable blurring of the gray-white matter junction in 
the inferior aspect of the right insula. There is a chronic left 
thalamic infarct.  
 
Nonspecific ground-glass airspace opacities are noted in both lung 
apices with nodular pleural parenchymal scarring in the left lung 
apex. There are partially imaged pleural effusions, bilaterally. 
Please correlate with dedicated imaging of the chest.  
 
Impression
 
CT perfusion: Large area of perfusion abnormality in the right MCA 
territory, as described above, suggesting at risk tissue with no 
definite core infarct. There may be some blurring of the gray-white 
matter differentiation in the inferior insula, concerning for 
infarct. MRI may be obtained, if warranted to better assess for the 
presence of core infarct, if any.  
 
CT angio of the neck: Complete occlusion of the left ICA from its 
origin with reconstitution of flow in the left ACA and left MCA via a 
patent anterior communicating artery. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Abrupt cut off of the M1 segment of the 
right MCA with relative paucity of vascular flow peripherally in the 
right MCA distribution. This distal flow on the right MCA territory 
is likely via collaterals.

Comparison
Prior head CT from 11/30/0 14 and 11/11/2013, report of the MRI of 
the brain from 12/01/2014.  
 
Findings
Again there are 2 parietal approach intraventricular catheters, tips 
in unchanged position within the trigone region of the ventricles.  
 
Again there is evidence of prior right frontal craniotomy. There is a 
limited evaluation of the upper brain parenchyma due to streak 
artifacts from the hardware.  
 
Again there is a heterogenous appearance of the high right frontal 
brain parenchyma with areas of low attenuation /water attenuation, 
chunky dystrophic calcifications, and patchy white matter 
hyperintensity, likely representing a combination of the treatment 
effects and residual tumor. As seen on the prior MRI, there is 
extension across the midline. Note that noncontrast CT is suboptimal 
for evaluation of tumor progression or change.  
 
There is a suggestion of increasing patchy cortical hyperdensity 
which is seen in the bifrontal biparietal regions, likely 
representing laminar necrosis in the setting of post RT.  
 
Again there is a right frontal extra-axial collection of low 
attenuation which measures up to 13 mm in short axis, slightly 
increased in size from the prior study and exerting mass effect upon 
the right frontal brain parenchyma. There is no evidence for midline 
shift.  
 
There is no evidence for hydrocephalus.  The ventricular pattern is 
grossly unchanged to the prior study.  
 
There is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses 
and mastoids. 
 
Impression

     1. Slight increase in size of the right frontal low attenuation 
extra-axial collection, currently measuring 13 mm (previously 
measuring approximate 10 mm). 
     2. Increasing /more prominent patchy cortical hyperdensity in 
the region of the tumor treatment bed, favored to represent laminar 
necrosis secondary to radiation. 
     3. Intraventricular catheters in place, no new or worsening 
hydrocephalus.

Findings
Portions of the study limited secondary to motion artifact especially 
the T1 post contrast imaging. The patient is status post left frontal 
craniotomy. Again seen is a resection cavity within the left frontal 
lobe which demonstrates some areas of susceptibility on the gradient 
imaging likely representing old hemorrhagic products. There is 
continued thickening and enhancement of the dura underlying the 
calvarial defect which is postsurgical in nature. There is ex vacuo 
dilatation of the frontal horn of the left lateral ventricle. There 
is a stable prominent enhancing vessels in the region of the surgical 
cavity. There is grossly stable FLAIR hyperintensity immediately 
surrounding the surgical cavity. Again seen is a masslike low T1 and 
high T2/FLAIR signal along the superior margin of the surgical cavity 
grossly unchanged from the most recent prior study.  However, this 
appears increased in size when compared to the prior study dated

associated sulcal effacement. No gross enhancement is noted within 
this region.  
There is no area of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction.  

There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. There 
is no midline shift. Again seen is a developmental venous anomaly 
within the left cerebellar region. There is a stable appearance of 
the left transverse sinus with portions appearing small in caliber.  
The pituitary gland is normal in size. 
Normal flow void is noted in the major arteries of the circle of 
Willis.  
There is minimal mucosal thickening throughout the paranasal sinuses.  

 
Impression
Limited study with an area of masslike lesion along the superior 
margin of the surgical cavity which appears grossly stable when 
compared to the most recent study.  However, this area of mass like 
lesion appears increased when compared to the prior study dated 
05/12/2013. This is concerning for progression of disease. 
Postcontrast imaging is limited without gross enhancement in this 
region suggestive of low grade tumor.

loss of volume of the parenchyma with persistent moderate enlargement 
of the lateral and 3rd ventricles and mild enlargement of the 4th 
ventricle.  There is unchanged dysmorphic appearance of the lateral 
ventricles with irregular contour. The constellation of findings are 
nonspecific, but may be the sequela of periventricular leukomalacia. 
There is unchanged nonspecific punctate calcification in the right 
frontal corona radiata. There is no mass effect or midline shift. 
Since the previous examination, there has been closure of the 
anterior fontanelle. There are no fluid levels in the visualized 
ethmoid air cells or developing maxillary sinuses.  
 
 
Impression
No significant interval change from 06/11/2014. Grossly stable volume 
loss and ventriculomegaly, as above, suggestive of periventricular 
leukomalacia.

Contrast
Contrast Agent OMNIPAQUE 300 100 milliliters 01/16/2015 INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
 
 
 
Comparison
CT with contrast from 01/06/2014. 
 
 
Findings
Again seen is a large skin defect at the vertex to the right of 
midline with mild enhancement along the margins, unchanged from prior 
exam and may represent postsurgical change or scar tissue. Subjacent 
to this skin defect, there is thinning of the calvarium which appears 
somewhat sclerotic.  
 
There is a rounded lymph node/soft tissue density in the left 
subocciptal region measuring up to approximately 1.4 cm. This is 
significantly increased in size compared to prior study where it 
measured approximately 4 mm. And slight irregularity in the left 
suboccipital soft tissues may represent scarring, and is without 
significant interval change from prior study. A possible lesion in 
this region can't be entirely excluded.  
The ventricles, cisterns and sulci are age appropriate in size.   
 
There is no mass effect, midline shift or  focal parenchymal

Impression

     1. No evidence of acute intracranial pathology. 
     2. Unchanged large scalp soft tissue defect at the vertex to the 
right of midline, likely related to postsurgical changes. Subjacent 
to the skin defect is thinning of the calvarium which appears 
somewhat sclerotic, also unchanged. 
     3. Left suboccipital rounded lymph node versus soft tissue 
lesion measuring up to 1.4 cm. This is intervally increased in size 
compared to prior study where it measured 4 mm. Finding is concerning 
for malignancy.

There is no loss of gray-white matter distinction or other sign of 
acute infarction. 
 
There is mild to moderate dilatation of both lateral ventricles and 
mild dilatation of the 3rd and 4th ventricle compatible with the 
patient's diagnosis hydrocephalus. The degree of hydrocephalus is 
remained unchanged in comparison to study.  There has been interval 
placement of a right parietal approach ventriculostomy catheter.  The 
catheter can be seen entering via a right parietal calvarial burr 
hole defect and transverses the right parietal lobe and enters the 
right lateral ventricle, the tip of which lies in close proximity to 
the foramina of Monroe and abutting the septum pellucidum. Trace 
amount of pneumocephalus noted within the temporal horn right lateral 
ventricle. Mild to moderate involutional changes are noted along with 
moderate chronic microvascular ischemic changes.  There is some mild 
mass effect upon the sulci of the bilateral frontal and parietal 
lobes near the vertex.  This can be seen in the setting of 
normal-pressure hydrocephalus. There is no evidence of intracranial 
hemorrhage. Other in the right parietal calvarial burr hole defect, 
the calvarium appears intact as is the skullbase.  There is some 
subcutaneous emphysema involving the right parietal scalp.  There is 
no significant paranasal sinus disease.  The bilateral mastoids 
appear well aerated.

Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the

Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
The vertex of the skull was not included in this exam.  
Motion results in streak artifact and significant image degradation, 
limiting evaluation.  
 
There is asymmetry in the soft tissues noted, with mild right-sided 
soft tissue swelling suspected. The axial bone windows demonstrate an 
asymmetrical left parietal lucency (series 14, axial image 75) 
extending into the squamosal portion of the left temporal bone (axial 
image 37), also seen on sagittal image 9, series 16.  
 
 
 
There is no obvious intracranial hemorrhage or large extra-axial 
collection.  
 
The ventricles, cisterns and sulci are age-appropriate in size. 
 
There is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses 
and mastoids. 
 
Impression
Asymmetrical left temporoparietal calvarial lucency suspicious for an 
age indeterminate nondisplaced skull fracture, contralateral to the 
mild right-sided soft tissue swelling. No obvious intracranial 
hemorrhage, however, there is significant degradation of the images 
by motion artifact which limits evaluation. Correlate with mechanism 
of injury. 
Vertex of the skull not included in the exam.  
 
Findings discussed with Dr. Kaplan at 1:22 p.m. 01/17/2015 via

Findings
There is no loss of gray-white matter distinction or other sign of 
acute infarction. Stable tissue loss and gliosis is noted in the left 
frontal lobe, compatible with old infarction involving the superior 
division of the left middle cerebral artery. There is also an old 
lacunar infarction involving the left thalamus. Bilateral 
periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensity is seen, 
consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic disease. There is no 
mass effect or midline shift. The ventricles in the cisterns were 
unremarkable.  There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial 
collection. Punctate hyperdense left parasagittal parietal lobe 
(series 2 image 44) is stable in size and appearance since the prior 
study and likely represents a small focus of dystrophic 
calcification.  
 
The calvarium and the skullbase intact.  Hyperostosis frontalis

Technique
CT perfusion: Before and during a contrast bolus injection, multiple 
5mm thick stacks of perfusion data were collected   .Following this, 
workstation technology was employed to create time of arrival, blood 
flow, mean transit time and blood volume color perfusion maps. 
 
CT angio of the neck: Following rapid IV bolus of contrast material, 
rapid helical imaging with very thin slices from the aortic arch to 
the lower cranial level was performed. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was utilized to create 3-D rendered MIP images.  NASCET 
methodology was employed to evaluate the degree of stenosis. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Following rapid injection of intravenous 
contrast material after an appropriate delay, very thin helical axial 
slices were obtained through the entire head. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was employed to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
 
Contrast
150 ml of Omnipaque 350 (patient received additional test bolus as 
initial IV access was insufficient).  
 
Comparison
CT angio of the head 02/20/2014  
 
Findings
CT perfusion: There is a perfusion deficit corresponding to the old 
right frontal lobe infarction.  There is no additional focus of 
abnormal perfusion to suggest a new focus of ischemia. 
 
CT angio of the neck: There is no evidence of greater than 30% 
stenosis or occlusion of the right or left carotid and vertebral 
arteries. There is no evidence of dissection. Incidental note is made 
of a mild to moderate amount of mixed plaque involving the aortic 
arch.  
 
CT angiography of the head: There is no evidence of aneurysm, AVM, 
dissection or vascular occlusive disease. 
 
Other: Patient is status post right thyroidectomy.  The left thyroid 
lobe is again noted to be heterogeneous and enlarged with coarse 
calcifications, without significant change in size or appearance 
given difference in technique and slice selection. Mild bilateral 
pleural apical thickening is noted.

History and Indication
H/O GBM S/P RESECTION 3/2014 S/P FALL, H/O THROMBOCYTOPENIA 
 
 
Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex. 
 
Comparison
Prior MR study dated 10/31/2014 and prior CT head dated 07/17/2014. 
 
Findings
The patient is status post right frontal temporal craniotomy. There 
is an area of hypoattenuation within the right frontal region which 
measures approximately 1.9 cm which appears slightly increased in 
size when compared to the prior CT study. There is increased 
calcification along the margins. When compared to the prior CT study 
there is increased hypoattenuation within the surrounding white 
matter. There is continued thickening and calcification of the dura 
underlying the calvarial defect. There is a partially empty sella.  
 
There is no significant mass effect or midline shift.  There are 
involutional changes without hydrocephalus.  There is small vessel 
disease.  There are multiple vascular calcifications.  
 
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. 
 
There is no acute calvarial fracture. 
 
There is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses 
and mastoids. 
 
Impression
Lesion within the right frontal lobe which appears slightly increased 
in size when compared to the prior CT study. Hypoattenuation within 
the surrounding white matter which appears increased in amount when 
compared to the prior study but is likely stable when compared to the 
most recent MR study dated 10/31/2014. This area may represent a 
combination of vasogenic edema and post treatment changes. Note, 
contrast-enhanced MR is more sensitive for residual tumor evaluation.

Technique
Multiple sequences were obtained through the brain without and with 
intravenous gadolinium. 
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent GADAVIST 10 milliliters 01/23/2015 INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
Comparison
MRI of the brain with without contrast from 10/31/2014. 
 
Findings
There is no area of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction.  

Again noted are postoperative changes incidental right frontal 
parietal craniotomy for resection of a glioblastoma within the right 
posterior frontal lobe. There and is encephalomalacia corresponding 
to the surgical bed. There remains some thick irregular heterogeneous 
enhancement along the margins of the surgical bed which is improved 
to a moderate degree in comparison to previous study indicating that 
these likely represent postoperative an treatment-related changes 
rather than residual neoplasm, however, continued followup is 
recommended. There is increased signal intensity in the T2, FLAIR 
proton density sequences within the right frontal and parietal lobes 
concerning mass effect upon the adjacent sulci likely representing 
residual edema which is improved in comparison to previous study. 
There is some reduced perfusion corresponding to the surgical bed.  
No other focus of reduced or increased perfusion is identified. There 
is some hemosiderin deposition along the margins of the surgical bed.  
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.  There is a 
small extra-axial collection adjacent to the right frontal parietal 
craniotomy site which has remained unchanged in comparison to study.  
There is no midline shift. The ventricles and cisterns are 
unremarkable.  There is no new enhancing abnormality involving the 
brain parenchyma or leptomeninges. The dural venous sinuses appear 
unremarkable.  There is no flow void abnormality to suggest a large 
aneurysm or AVM. 
 
Impression
Interval improvement in the enhancement along the margins of the 
surgical bed as described above. No evidence of recurrent neoplasm. 
Interval improvement in the residual edema within the right frontal 
and parietal lobes as described above.  Postoperative changes 
consistent with a right frontotemporal craniotomy. No new enhancing 
abnormality. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.  Stable 
residual extra-axial collection adjacent to the right frontoparietal 
craniotomy defect.

Impression

     1. No acute intracranial pathology.
     2. Multiple, dural based extra-axial calcified lesions, many of 
which appear to be  subcentimeter in size as described above, the 
largest measuring approximately 2 cm within the right parasagittal 
occipital region. These are highly favored to represent multiple 
hemangiomas and are much less likely to represent dural-based 
metastases given heavy calcification.

Clinical History
Right thalamic hemorrhage.  
 
Technique
CT angio of the neck: Following rapid IV bolus of contrast material, 
rapid helical imaging with very thin slices from the aortic arch to 
the lower cranial level was performed. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was utilized to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
NASCET methodology was employed to evaluate the degree of stenosis. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Following rapid injection of intravenous 
contrast material after an appropriate delay, very thin helical axial 
slices were obtained through the entire head. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was employed to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent OMNIPAQUE 350 100 milliliters 12/18/2014 INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
Comparison

Findings
CT angio of the neck: There is no evidence of stenosis or occlusion 
of the right or left carotid and vertebral arteries. Endotracheal 
tube noted.  Retained fluid in the oropharynx.  
 
CT angiography of the head: There is no evidence of aneurysm or AVM.  
There is irregularity of the lumen of the right anterior cerebral 
artery, with a mild stenosis in the A2/A3 bifurcation and a 
mild-to-moderate stenosis A3 segment, series 603 image 49.  
 
Extravascular findings: No significant abnormalities. 
 
Impression
CT angio of the neck: No focal stenosis. Torturous proximal ICA 
bilaterally with a bending or  kinked appearance.  
 
CT angiography of the head: Luminal irregularity of the right 
anterior cerebral artery with mild stenosis at A2/3 and mild to 
moderate stenosis at A3. This is of uncertain etiology, vasospasm is 
thought unlikely given the lack of subarachnoid hemorrhage or 
hematoma surrounds the ACA.

12/19/2014 at 6:21 a.m. 
 
Findings
There is a new small right parietal craniotomy with overlying plate 
and screw cranioplasty for access for the Apollo procedure. There has 
been partial evacuation of the large right basilar ganglia, thalamic 
and right frontoparietal corona radiata hematoma. Scattered air is 
noted within the hematoma and along the surgical path through the 
right parietal lobe. Air is also noted in the right lateral ventricle 
which is otherwise filled with hyperdense hemorrhage. A small amount 
of hemorrhage is noted in the left lateral ventricle along with air 
seen in the frontal horn and anterior body. The ventricular catheter 
is again noted near the left foramen of Monro. The left lateral 
ventricle is smaller and is mostly compressed except for the 
posterior body and trigone. The 3rd ventricle is filled with 
hemorrhage and displaced to the left of midline. The subfalcine shift 
to the left is increased to 60 mm compared to 10 mm on the prior 
study. There is a tiny amount of hemorrhage in the 4th ventricle. 
There is a fairly large collection of air seen in the anterior right 
frontal and right temporal regions which displaces the brain. This 
collection and pneumocephalus measures 17 mm at its thickest in the 
frontal region. There is minimal hemorrhage along the tentorium. 
 
Again seen is gliosis in the left frontal corona radiata from prior 
hemorrhagic infarct. 
 
There is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses 
and mastoids.  
 
Impression
Status post partial evacuation of the large right sided hematoma with 
significant residual.  Prominent pneumocephalus specially in the 
right frontal and anterior temporal regions. Increase in subfalcine 
shift to 16 mm from 10 mm. Persistent intraventricular hemorrhage as 
described.

Comparison
CT head from 12/19/2014  
 
Findings
The patient remains status post right parietal craniotomy with small 
sub adjacent hemorrhage and air. There is resolving pneumocephalus 
over the frontal convexities bilaterally. There has been partial 
evacuation of the large right basilar ganglia, thalamic and right 
frontotemporoparietal hematoma with resolving foci of air.  The 
hemorrhage measures approximately 5.3 x 6.0 x 4.3 centimeters in AP, 
transverse and longitudinal dimensions, respectively previously 
approximately 4.6 x 4.7 x 6.6 centimeters. In the interim, there has 
been increase in volume and density of the hemorrhage in the right 
corona radiata, for instance, comparing series 302, image 31 with the 
prior study series 300, image 29). There remains extensive hemorrhage 
within the right frontal horn of the lateral ventricle, larger on the 
current study, with moderate hemorrhage now noted within the left 
body/ occipital horn as small hemorrhage within the right occipital 
horn of the lateral ventricles. Redemonstrated is hemorrhage within 
the 3rd ventricle, which is displaced to the left of midline, on and 
4th ventricle. A left frontal approach ventricular catheter is again 
noted to be in place, with the distal tip of the left frontal horn 
near the foramen of Monro. There is resolving intraventricular air 
within the left frontal horn, also new areas noted within the left 
temporal horn. Given differences in technique, the ventricles are 
likely not significantly changed in size and remain moderately 
dilated. There is significant edema within the right cerebral 
hemisphere surrounding hemorrhage with mass effect, sulcal effacement 
and left-to-right midline shift which measures approximately 1.6 
centimeters, and appears slightly decreased from the prior study when 
it measured approximately 1.9 centimeters. There is no tonsillar 
herniation. The right aspect of the suprasellar cistern is effaced.  
There is mild mass-effect on the midbrain by the right uncus.  
Multiple foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage are noted, most prominently 
over the left convexity, more prominent than on the prior 
examination. There is thin hypoattenuating extra-axial collection 
over the left cerebral hemisphere, more prominent than on the prior 
study.  
Again seen is gliosis in the left frontal corona radiata from prior 
hemorrhagic infarct. 
There is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses 
and mastoids. Prior left parietal vertex burr hole. 
 
 
Impression
Status post partial evacuation of the large right sided cerebral 
hematoma with significant residual, which is increasing in density 
and size in the region of the right corona radiata. Resolving 
pneumocephalus and air within the hemorrhage. Slight interval 
decrease in subfalcine herniation, which now measures approximately 
1.6 centimeters. Left convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage, more 
prominent than was seen on the prior study. The ventricles are not 
significantly changed in size remain moderately distended with 
hemorrhage ; there is increased hyperdense hemorrhage within the 
right frontal horn and the occipital horns bilaterally, greater on 
the left. Thin hypoattenuating extra-axial collection over the left 
cerebral hemisphere, more prominent than on the prior study. Other 
findings as above.

Findings
There is a left frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter, with the 
catheter tip unchanged in position, terminating in the left lateral 
ventricle, adjacent to the foramen of Monro. There has been mild 
interval decompression of the size of the ventricular system. 
 
There has been interval resolution of the air within the ventricles 
and right basal ganglia. There is mild persistent pneumocephalus 
along the anterior left frontal lobe convexity.  
 
There is unchanged large, heterogeneous area of hemorrhage involving 
the right thalamus and right basal ganglia extending into the right 
medial temporal lobe and extending superiorly into the right corona 
radiata, with extensive surrounding edema. This is similar in size to 
the prior exam.  There is unchanged intraventricular extension of 
hemorrhage with blood layering in the lateral, 3rd and 4th 
ventricles. There is unchanged mass effect with compression of the 
right lateral ventricle. 
 
There is this persistent right-to-left midline shift, measuring 
approximately 15-16 millimeters, unchanged from the prior exam. There 
is mild medialization of the right uncus, unchanged.  
 
There is unchanged mild subarachnoid hemorrhage, scattered 
bilaterally.  There is a predominantly hypodense extra-axial 
collection along the convexity of the left frontotemporal and left 
parietal lobes, which is slightly increased in size since the prior 
exam, measuring 8 millimeters in maximum thickness (previously

Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
Multiple areas of T2/FLAIR abnormality are seen within the juxta 
cortical, subcortical, and periventricular white matter of the 
bilateral cerebral hemispheres. Additional areas of T2 FLAIR 
abnormality are seen within the pons and middle cerebellar peduncles 
bilaterally. None of these lesions demonstrate enhancement or 
restricted diffusion. There are black holes noted. There are Dawson's 
fingers. But are more than 9 lesions. There is a juxta cortical 
lesion. The findings satisfy criteria for separation of lesions in 
space in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.  
 
A subcentimeter focus of enhancement is noted within the right 
caudate nucleus. There is a susceptibility related to the small 
lesion on the gradient sequence.  This may represent a small 
cavernoma. There is no abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement. None of 
the white matter lesions enhance with contrast. No abnormal foci of 
enhancement are seen in the bilateral orbits or optic nerves.  
 
There is no area of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction.  

 
The ventricles are normal. There is mild cerebral cortical atrophy, 
advanced for age. There is no significant atrophy of the cerebellum 
or corpus callosum.  
There is no mass effect or midline shift. 
There is no recent intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. 
The pituitary gland is small with a partially empty sella turcica. 
Normal flow void is noted in the major arteries of the circle of 
Willis.  
There is no significant disease in the paranasal sinuses. 
 
Impression

     1. Multiple foci of T2/FLAIR abnormality within the gross 
cerebral hemispheres, pons, and cerebellum as described above, 
diagnostic of multiple sclerosis. There are no contrast enhancing 
white matter lesions noted to suggest active demyelination. 
     2. Unremarkable bilateral orbits. 
     3. Subcentimeter focus of enhancement within the right caudate 
nucleus, which likely represents a small cavernoma but is 
nonspecific.

History and Indication
FALL 
 
Technique
1.  Contiguous axial CT images of the head were obtained without 
intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were 
obtained.  
 
2.  Contiguous axial CT images of the cervical spine were obtained 
without intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions 
were obtained.  
 
Comparison
CT cervical spine dated 06/22/2014. CT head dated 06/22/2014.  
 
Findings
CT head: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or 
acute transcortical infarct. An arachnoid cyst along the anterior 
left temporal convexity, within the middle cranial fossa, is 
unchanged in size, minimal flattening of the underlying parenchyma. 
Otherwise, no mass effect, midline shift or hydrocephalus. Patchy 
areas of low attenuation in the deep and subcortical white matter, 
similar to the prior exam,  nonspecific, possibly representing the 
sequela of small vessel ischemia. The calvarium is intact. Visualized 
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  
 
CT cervical spine: There is reversal of the cervical curvature, with 
the apex of kyphotic angulation at C3-C4, unchanged from the prior 
exam. There is trace anterolisthesis of C3 on C4 and minimal 
retrolisthesis of C5 on C6, presumably degenerative. No evidence of 
acute fracture in the cervical spine.  
 
There is disc space narrowing with endplate sclerosis, osteophyte 
formation at all levels from C2-C3 through C6-C7. Evaluation of 
intraspinal canal soft tissues is limited on CT.  There is herniation 
epidural collection or cord pathology is clinically warranted, then 
MRI should be obtained. Atlantoaxial degenerative changes are 
present.  Anterior arch of C1 is intact.  Odontoid is grossly intact.  

 
At C2-C3, predominant facet arthrosis resulting in mild narrowing of 
the right foramen.  
At C3-C4, posterior facet uncinate hypertrophy, left more than right, 
resulting in moderate to severe bilateral neural foraminal narrowing 
(left more than right). Bold anterolisthesis and posterior arch 
hypertrophy ileus mildly compromising the canal.  
At C4-C5, mild facet arthrosis results in mild bilateral neural 
foraminal narrowing.  
At C5-C6, left uncinate hypertrophy and facet arthrosis result in 
mild to moderate left neural foraminal narrowing. Retrolisthesis, 
left paracentral disc osteophyte complex and posterior arch 
hypertrophy mildly compromising the canal.  
At C6-C7, retrolisthesis and posterior hypertrophy mildly compromise 
the canal. The neural foramina are patent. Mild posterior facet 
arthrosis.  
At C7-T1, no significant narrowing is noted. 
 
Vascular calcifications are present in both carotid bulbs.  There is 
diffuse soft tissue fullness and wall diaries ring, presumably 
tonsillar/adenoidal hypertrophy.  Punctate calcification in the 
tonsillar pillars may represent pelvic phleboliths.  
 
Comparison
1. No significant interval change from 06/22/2014. No evidence of 
acute intracranial hemorrhage or skull fracture.  
 
2.  No evidence of an acute fracture in the cervical spine. Reversal 
of cervical curvature. Trace anterolisthesis of C3 on C4 and minimal 
retrolisthesis of C5 on C6 are presumably degenerative.  
 
3. Multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine, as above.

Comparison
Multiple prior MRIs, most recent from November 17, 2014.  
 
Findings
The patient remains status post right frontotemporoparietal 
craniotomy with associated postsurgical changes. Again seen is FLAIR 
signal abnormality extending from the anterior and lateral right 
temporal lobe into the right frontal operculum and the subinsular 
region, which is increased in extent compared to the examination from 
10/01/14 and demonstrates slight diffusion hyperintensity indicative 
of hypercellularity. There is heterogeneous T2 hyperintensity within 
the surgical bed, which contains intrinsic T1 hyperintensity, 
susceptibility artifact and diffusion hyperintensity indicative of 
resolving late subacute blood products, with residual nodular 
contrast enhancement at its periphery extending extra-axial along the 
craniotomy. Overall, the resection cavity is smaller on the current 
examination, compatible with its contraction.  
 
Persistent area of FLAIR signal abnormality within the right frontal 
corona radiata and periventricular white matter is noted, which may 
represent sequelae of microvascular ischemic disease or posttreatment 
changes.  
No evidence of acute infarct, acute intracranial hemorrhage, or 
extra-axial collection. There is mild cerebral and cerebellar volume 
loss and ex vacuo ventricular prominence.  
There is no significant disease in the paranasal sinuses. The mastoid 
air cells are clear.  
The orbits are grossly unremarkable. 
 
Impression
Continued retraction of the surgical cavity with persistent 
peripheral nodular enhancement most compatible with residual disease. 
Increase in surrounding FLAIR signal abnormality since October 2014. 
Continued followup advised.

Findings
The patient is status post right sided craniotomy with a resection 
cavity involving the right frontal and right temporal lobes.  There 
is susceptibility on the gradient imaging within the resection cavity 
consistent with old hemorrhagic products. There is thickening and 
enhancement of the dura underlying the calvarial defect which is 
postsurgical in nature. There is grossly stable FLAIR signal with 
mass effect involving gyri within the posterior inferior right 
frontal lobe and gyri of the anterior medial temporal lobe. There is 
no abnormal enhancement in these regions.  There is grossly stable 
FLAIR hyperintensity surrounding the remaining surgical cavity.  
There is a stable areas of nodular enhancement within the medial 
superior and posterior aspects of the resection cavity.  
There is no area of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction. 
There is no hydrocephalus.  
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection.  
Normal flow void is noted in the major arteries of the circle of 
Willis.  
There is no significant disease in the paranasal sinuses. 
There is a grossly stable lesion involving the right aspect of the 
pituitary gland.  
 
Impression
Stable postsurgical changes as described above with stable nodular 
enhancement along the margins of the resection cavity.  Stable 
thickening involving multiple gyri within the posterior inferior 
right frontal lobe and the anterior medial right temporal lobe 
without enhancement.  Continued followup is recommended to exclude 
residual neoplasm.  
Stable pituitary lesion.

Contrast Agent GADAVIST 6.5 milliliters 01/12/2015 INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
Comparison
Prior study November 21, 2014 as well as September 11, 2014.  
 
Findings
The patient remains status post right frontal craniotomy extending to 
the left of midline with the CSF intensity resection cavity in the 
right anterior frontal lobe. Subadjacent to the craniotomy there is 
an 8 millimeter thick, slightly diminishing postsurgical extra-axial 
collection. Redemonstrated is mildly FLAIR hyperintense layering 
debris in the surgical cavity which may represent hemorrhagic or 
proteinaceous products.  Susceptibility artifact again noted around 
the edges well as layering dependently within the surgical cavity 
related to blood products. Additional susceptibility artifact noted 
from surgical hardware in this area. Again seen is FLAIR signal 
abnormality at the posterior, lateral and inferior margins of the 
resection cavity extending to the frontal horn of the right lateral 
ventricle, most compatible with gliosis.  
 
Post-contrast images demonstrate smooth linear peripheral enhancement 
along the surgical cavity which appears essentially unchanged, with 
associated dural thickening and dural enhancement. Additionally, 
there appears to be a possible new focus of nodular enhancement 
measuring 2-3 mm which is seen adjacent to the posterolateral aspect 
of the surgical cavity just anterior to the sylvian fissure, series 9 
images 102-103, with associated 6 millimeter focus of FLAIR signal 
abnormality (series 700 image 73), not definitively seen on the prior 
study. There is no abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement. 
No abnormal perfusion is seen.  
 
No acute infarct or new intracranial hemorrhage. No mass effect or 
midline shift.  
The pituitary gland is normal in size. 
There is mild scattered mucosal thickening throughout the paranasal 
sinuses. The mastoid air cells are clear.  
The orbits are grossly unremarkable. 
 
Impression
Suspected new punctate area of enhancement measuring 2-3 mm adjacent 
to the posterior lateral aspect of the resection cavity; attention on 
close imaging follow up recommended.  
Postsurgical changes status post right frontal craniotomy and tumor 
resection.

Comparison
Head CT dated 08/20/2014.  
 
Findings
Examination is limited by motion, resulting in artifact and image 
degradation.  
 
Again redemonstrated is embolic material, centered in the right 
thalamus and basal ganglia, involving the right cerebral peduncle, 
right parietal lobe, massa intermedia and left thalamus. There are 
unchanged areas of low attenuation lateral to this embolic material. 
Again redemonstrated are unchanged dilated vessels extending towards 
the right thalamus and cerebral peduncle. Residual nidus cannot be 
assessed or excluded without intravenous contrast.  
 
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute 
territorial infarction. Prominence of the cortical sulci is again 
noted bilaterally, more than expected for the patient's age. There is 
no mass effect or midline shift.  There is no evidence of 
hydrocephalus.

Multiple hyperintense foci are noted in the cerebral white matter 
bilaterally on FLAIR and T2 images representing chronic small vessel 
disease. There is a large focus of heterogeneous hypodensity in 
medial right parietal occipital lobes on the MPGR images  likely 
hemosiderin staining, sequela of prior hemorrhage.  In addition, 
there multiple tiny hypodense foci in the right occipital lobe and 
adjacent inferior temporal lobe on MPGR images likely additional foci 
of hemosiderin deposition from micro hemorrhages. Small foci of FLAIR 
hyperintensity are noted in the mid vermis posteriorly and also in 
the left cerebral hemisphere likely small foci of old infarcts.  
Ventricles, cisterns and sulci are age appropriate in size.

Technique
Noncontrast CT head: Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the 
skull base to the vertex without contrast. Coronal and sagittal 
reconstructions were obtained.  
 
CT angio of the neck: Following rapid IV bolus of contrast material, 
rapid helical imaging with very thin slices from the aortic arch to 
the lower cranial level was performed. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was utilized to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Following rapid injection of intravenous 
contrast material after an appropriate delay, very thin helical axial

Contrast
Contrast Agent OMNIPAQUE 350 90 mg/dl 01/23/2015 INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
Comparison
No prior CTA is available for comparison. Head CT dated 01/20/2015 is 
used for comparison.  
 
Correlation is made with the MRI exam brain, MRA head/neck, dated 
01/20/2015.  
 
Findings
Noncontrast CT head:  
There is no evidence of acute transcortical infarction, acute 
intracranial hemorrhage or focal extra-axial collection. 
Redemonstrated are the extensive, severe confluent areas of low 
attenuation within the deep and subcortical white matter with 
multiple scattered subacute and chronic deep white matter infarcts, 
involving biilateral corona radiata, periventricular white matter and 
right thalamus. Patchy areas of low attenuation are also noted 
throughout the gangliocapsular regions. These are similar to the 
prior exam and most compatible with the sequela of severe small 
vessel ischemia. There are generalized age-related involutional 
changes with secondary prominence of the CSF spaces.  There is no 
evidence of hydrocephalus.  There is no mass effect or midline shift. 
Extensive vascular calcifications are present along both internal 
carotid artery siphons.  
 
Bony calvarium is intact.  There is diffuse opacification of the 
right maxillary sinus with chronic osteitis of the maxillary sinus 
wall.  Right maxillary infundibulum appears somewhat widened.  There 
is also mucosal thickening in the inferior frontal sinuses and 
anterior right ethmoid air cells.  Visualized mastoid air cells are 
clear. The visualized intraorbital contents are unremarkable.  
 
CTA neck: There is mild calcification along the aortic arch, 
involving the takeoff of the great vessels.  
Right common carotid artery: Normal course and caliber. No 
hemodynamically significant stenosis.  
Right internal carotid artery: Origin is patent.  There is mild 
calcified and noncalcified plaque at the origin, resulting in 
irregularity with minimal narrowing, but no significant stenosis 
(<25%).  
Right external carotid artery: Unremarkable.  
 
Left common carotid artery: Normal course and caliber with no 
hemodynamically significant stenosis.  
Left internal carotid artery: Origin is patent.  There is mild 
calcified and noncalcified plaque at the origin resulting in 
irregularity with minimal narrowing, but no significant stenosis 
(<30%).  
Left external carotid arteries: unremarkable.  
 
The left vertebral artery is mildly dominant. The origins of the 
vertebral arteries are patent with no significant stenosis. V1 and V2 
segments demonstrating normal course and caliber with no 
hemodynamically significant stenosis. There is mild narrowing of the 
V2 segment of the left vertebral artery at the level of the C5 and C6 
foramina transversarium.  
 
There is diffuse cervical spondylosis.  
 
There is prominent soft tissue throughout Waldeyer' ring, most likely 
attributed to tonsillar hypertrophy. Please correlate with direct 
visualization. There are punctate calcifications in the left lingual 
tonsil and right palatine tonsil, representing incidental 
tonsilliths.  
 
There are numerous subcentimeter level 1B and level 5 lymph nodes, 
bilaterally. There is a somewhat rounded right level 2A lymph node 
measuring 1.7 cm and mildly prominent left level 2A lymph node 
measuring 1.5 cm. There is a mildly prominent 1.1 cm right level 4 
lymph node. 
 
There is heterogeneous enlargement of the left lobe of the thyroid 
gland with and isoattenuating nodule in the inferior pole, which 
measures 2.2 x 2.0 CM.  Please correlate with thyroid sonogram and 
patient's history. Tiny bullae are noted in both lung apices.  
 
CTA head:  
Anterior circulation: There is extensive calcification with mild 
narrowing of the cavernous segments of both internal carotid 
arteries. There is no occlusion or hemodynamically significant 
stenosis in the anterior circulation. The right M2 is asymmetrically 
smaller in caliber when compared with the left M2. Hypoplastic 
posterior communicating arteries are present. There is flow related 
enhancement within the proximal ophthalmic arteries, bilaterally.  
 
Posterior circulation: There is mild calcification and irregularity 
of the V4 segment of the left vertebral artery. There is no occlusion 
or hemodynamically significant stenosis in the posterior circulation. 
There are bilateral superior cerebellar arteries, hypoplastic right 
anterior inferior cerebellar arteries and bilateral posterior 
inferior cerebellar arteries.  
 
There is no evidence of aneurysm or gross AVM in the circle of 
Willis.  
 
Impression

     1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute 
territorial infarction. 
     2. No hemodynamically significant stenosis in the carotid or 
vertebral arteries, within the neck. 
     3. No occlusion or hemodynamically significant stenosis in the 
circle of Willis. 
     4. Severe small-vessel ischemic changes, similar to the prior 
exam, with multiple old infarcts scattered in the deep white matter 
and right thalamus. Please correlate with the recently performed MRI 
brain. 
     5. Enlarged left lobe of the thyroid gland with a 2.2 cm nodule. 
Although this likely represents a goiter, neoplasia cannot be 
excluded. Please correlate with patient's history, with nonemergent 
thyroid sonogram, nuclear I-123 scintigraphy and /or FNA. 
     6. Borderline sized cervical lymph node, as described above. 
These are nonspecific and possibly reactive. Pathologic lymph nodes 
are less likely. Please correlate clinically, correlate with 
patient's history and immune status. 
     7. Chronic right maxillary sinus disease.

Status post right frontal burr hole for previous biopsy of the known 
right periventricular mass. There has been further interval evolution 
of gliosis and encephalomalacia around the frontal horn of the right 
lateral ventricle consistent with postprocedure/post treatment 
changes. Previously seen acute blood from the prior CT/MRI in this 
area has resolved.   
There has been interval evolution of hyperdensity previously seen 
within the paramedian high left frontal lobe with associated expected 
dilatation of the left lateral ventricle, compatible with evolving 
encephalomalacia/ gliosis.  
Patchy foci of hypoattenuation within the periventricular and 
subcortical white matter without mass effect are most compatible with 
microvascular ischemic changes given presence of atherosclerotic 
calcifications at the skullbase.  
 
There is no hydrocephalus.  
Mastoid air cells are clear. There is no significant mucosal 
thickening throughout the visualized paranasal sinuses.  Partially

Technique
CT perfusion: Before and during a contrast bolus injection, multiple 
5mm thick stacks of perfusion data were collected   .Following this, 
workstation technology was employed to create time of arrival, blood 
flow, mean transit time and blood volume color perfusion maps. 
 
CT angio of the neck: Following rapid IV bolus of contrast material, 
rapid helical imaging with very thin slices from the aortic arch to 
the lower cranial level was performed. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was utilized to create 3-D rendered MIP images.  NASCET 
methodology was employed to evaluate the degree of stenosis. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Following rapid injection of intravenous 
contrast material after an appropriate delay, very thin helical axial 
slices were obtained through the entire head. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was employed to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
 
 
Contrast

Comparison
No prior studies are available for direct comparison.  Non contrast 
enhanced head CT from 01/18/2013 at 8:23 p.m. was reviewed.  
 
Findings
Study is significantly limited due to image degradation by patient 
motion, particularly the intracranial portion.  
 
CT perfusion: There is nonspecific mildly increased IRF in the left 
posterior temporal region. 
 
CT angio of the neck: Evaluation of the origins of the bilateral 
carotid and vertebral arteries is limited. There is suggestion of at 
least 50 percent stenosis of the distal left internal carotid artery. 
There is otherwise no evidence of greater than 30% stenosis or 
occlusion of the right or left carotid and vertebral arteries. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Image degradation due to motion artifact 
makes evaluation of the the intracranial vascular structures 
virtually nondiagnostic.  There is suggestion of high-grade focal 
stenosis in the distal right vertebral artery.  
 
Impression
Study is significantly limited due to patient motion.  
CT perfusion: Suggestion of nonspecific mildly increased in the left 
posterior temporal region which may be artifactual. 
 
CT angio of the neck: Suggestion of approximately 50 percent stenosis 
in the distal left internal carotid artery. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Virtually nondiagnostic exam due to 
patient motion. Suggestion of focal high grade stenosis in the distal 
right vertebral artery. 
 
Considered limited brain MR with FLAIR and diffusion imaging for 
further evaluation in a compatible patient.

Clinical History
Glioblastoma status post excision in November 2014, chemotherapy and 
radiation. Additional history of basilar tip aneurysm.  
 
 
Technique
Multiple sequences were obtained through the brain without and with 
intravenous gadolinium. 
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent GADAVIST 7 milliliters 01/16/2015 INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
Comparison
November 5, 2014.  
 
Findings
Several sequences are limited due to patient motion and artifact.  
 
The patient is status post right parietal craniotomy with a resection 
cavity re-identified in the right parietal lobe which has decreased 
in size since prior exam. There is linear enhancement along the 
surgical margin with nodular enhancement along the posterior aspect 
of the surgical cavity. There is also unchanged in size nodular 
enhancement deep to surgical cavity which likely represents residual 
tumor. There is markedly increased extent of T2 and FLAIR signal 
abnormality, with gyral thickening and extending into the right 
frontal lobe, and temporal, occipital lobes, as well as across the 
splenium of the corpus callosum into the contralateral deep white 
matter which may represent edema and/ or tumor infiltration. New 
focus of enhancement seen in the right periatrial periventricular 
white matter and along the ventricular surface of the atria likely 
reflecting infiltrating tumor with ependymal involvement. There is 
associated restricted diffusion involving the tumor mass reflecting 
high cellularity.  
 
Additional punctate FLAIR hyperintense white-matter lesions are noted 
consistent with small vessel disease versus treatment related change. 
Hemosiderin deposition again noted around the margins of the surgical 
cavity.  No other intracranial hemorrhage. Right occipital lobe 
developmental venous anomaly again noted.  
 
The pituitary gland is normal in size. 
Basilar apex aneurysm again re-identified, please refer to dictation 
for the concurrently performed MR angiography.  
There is no significant disease in the paranasal sinuses. 
The orbits are grossly unremarkable. 
 
Impression
Nodular enhancement along the surgical margin with additional nodular 
enhancement deep within the right parietal lobe, periventricular 
white matter, and ependymal surface along with masslike FLAIR 
abnormality involving adjacent white matter and corpus callosum 
consistent with tumor progression.

Comparison
CT head from 11/13/2014  
 
Findings
Motion results in streak artifact and significant image degradation, 
limiting evaluation. Images of the posterior and middle cranial fossa 
are markedly degraded and are nearly nondiagnostic.  
 
 
Redemonstrated are multiple periventricular white matter 
hypodensities which are most compatible with involving infarcts seen 
on MRI. There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or 
extra-axial collection. There is no significant mass effect or 
midline shift.  
Patchy foci of hypoattenuation within the periventricular and 
subcortical white matter without mass effect are most compatible with 
microvascular ischemic changes given presence of atherosclerotic 
calcifications at the skullbase. There is moderate age-related 
cerebral and cerebellar volume loss with ex vacuo ventricular 
prominence. The basal cisterns are patent. 
 
The calvarium is intact.  
There is no significant paranasal sinus or mastoid air cell disease. 
 
 
Impression
Limited examination. Multiple periventricular hypodensities most 
compatible with known evolving infarcts without CT evidence of 
hemorrhagic transformation.

late subacute hematoma with associated susceptibility artifact and 
hemosiderin rim with associated mass effect, edema, marked effacement 
of the left lateral ventricle and rightward midline shift which 
measures approximately 9 millimeters, without change from the prior 
study. Underlying lesion cannot be excluded in the absence of 
intravenous contrast. The surrounding FLAIR some signal 
abnormality/edema has increased from the prior MRI examination. There 
has been a decrease and evolution of intraventricular hemorrhage

Clinical History
Intracranial hemorrhage, for followup evaluation  
 
 
Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex. 
 
Comparison
CT head from 11/28/2014  
 
Findings
There has been continued evolution of multiple subcentimeter infarcts 
within the bilateral centrum semiovale and corona radiata, seen to 
better advantage on the 11/15/2014 MRI brain. There has likewise been 
interval evolution of foci of intraparenchymal hemorrhage, with 
several residual foci within the left basal ganglia (series 300, 
axial image 21). There is slightly diminished associated mass effect 
on the left lateral ventricle come with persistent effacement of the 
left sylvian fissure, adjacent sulci and mild residual rightward 
midline shift which measures approximately 6 millimeters at the level 
of the foramen of Monro. The basal cisterns are patent.  There is no 
tonsillar herniation. There is no extra-axial collection or new 
intracranial hemorrhage.  
 
The hemorrhage seen layering within the occipital horns has resolved 
in the interim. The ventricles are unchanged in size from the prior 
examination.  
Patchy foci of hypoattenuation within the periventricular and 
subcortical white matter without mass effect are most compatible with 
microvascular ischemic changes given presence of atherosclerotic 
calcifications at the skullbase.  
 
Bifrontal burr holes are again seen. There is resolving mild mucosal 
thickening within the sphenoid sinuses. Mastoid air cells are clear. 
Visualized orbits are unremarkable.  
 
Impression
Continued evolution of multiple small infarcts and left-sided 
intraparenchymal hemorrhage, with several small residual foci within 
the left basal ganglia. Slightly diminishing mass-effect, although 
persistent rightward midline shift remains. No new intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage is noted. Interval resolution of intraventricular 
hemorrhage with stable ventricular size. Otherwise, no significant 
change from the prior examination.

prominence of the left atrium possibly related to early 
hydrocephalus.  
 
There is no evidence for acute or subacute evolving infarct.  There 
is no evidence for extra-axial collection. The pituitary gland is 
normal in size. There is a small developmental venous anomaly in the 
left cerebellum.  
Normal flow void is noted in the major arteries of the circle of 
Willis.  
There is partial opacification of the right maxillary sinus.  There 
is a small mucous retention cyst within the left maxillary sinus.  
The orbits are grossly unremarkable. 
 
Impression
Multiple rim enhancing lesions in the right cerebral hemisphere with 
surrounding edema, mass effect characterized by the midline shift and 
mild uncal herniation ; this likely represents metastatic lesions, 
infection is felt to be less likely.

MRI 12/02/2014 
 
Findings
This study was performed for stereotactic planning.  Fiducials are in 
place. 
These 3 lesions in the right temporal lobe with surrounding edema are 
again noted.  There is partial hyperdensity of these lesions 
consistent with known hemorrhage. There is also mass effect with 
effacement of sulci and medial displacement and partial compression 
of the right temporal horn, right trigone and body of the right 
lateral ventricle. A small subfalcine shift to the left is again 
noted. An additional hyperdense lesion is noted in the right frontal 
lobe which was also present on the MRI study and has modest 
surrounding edema.  
 
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus.  
 
There is no other focal parenchymal abnormality.  
 
 
The calvarium is intact. 
 
There is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses 
and mastoids.

Comparison
CT head from 12/7/14. Correlation is made to MRI brain from 
12/02/2014.  
 
Findings
The patient is status post interval right frontotemporoparietal 
craniotomy with associated overlying soft tissue swelling, with a 
drainage catheter in place terminating within the soft tissues 
overlying the right middle cranial fossa. There is mild 
pneumocephalus subjacent to the craniotomy flap and overlying the 
right frontal convexity. There is a minimal heterogeneous extra-axial 
collection subjacent to the craniotomy. There are hypoattenuating 
resection cavities with peripheral hyper attenuation which likely 
reflects blood products and or hemostatic material within the 
anterolateral right temporal lobe as well as the left temporoparietal 
region. The hemorrhagic right frontal lobe lesion remains unchanged 
from the preoperative examination, measuring approximately 1.5 
centimeters (series 300, axial image 252). There are suspected 
residual hyperdense lesions within the brain right temporal lobe 
anterior and posterior to the resection cavity (axial image 209). 
There is persistent associated mass effect and edema within the right 
cerebral hemisphere with sulcal effacement, partial effacement of the 
right lateral ventricle and left-to-right midline shift which 
measures approximately 8 millimeters, unchanged from the preoperative 
study. The left lateral ventricle, particularly the occipital horn, 
remains mildly enlarged.  
 
There is no CT evidence of acute transcortical infarction. 
Patchy foci of hypoattenuation within the periventricular and 
subcortical white matter without mass effect are most compatible with 
microvascular ischemic changes given presence of atherosclerotic 
calcifications at the skullbase.  
 
There is small mucous retention cysts within the bilateral maxillary 
sinuses.  The mastoid air cells are clear. Visualized orbits are 
unremarkable.  
 
Impression
Status post interval frontotemporoparietal craniotomy with associated 
postsurgical changes and resection cavities within the right

intensity extra-axial collection subjacent to the craniotomy site 
measuring 2 mm. There are resection cavities with peripheral gradient 
echo blooming and restricted diffusion compatible with blood products 
and slightly irregular T1 hyperintensity pre- and post-contrast along 
the margins within the anterolateral right temporal lobe as well as 
the left temporoparietal region limiting evaluation for subtle 
enhancement. The hemorrhagic and heterogeneously enhancing right 
frontal lobe lesion remains unchanged from the preoperative 
examination, measuring approximately 1.5 cm. There is extensive FLAIR 
hyperintensity within the right temporal lobe anterior and posterior 
to the resection cavity. There is persistent FLAIR hyperintensity 
associated mass effect and edema within the right cerebral hemisphere 
with sulcal effacement, partial compression of the right lateral 
ventricle, and leftward midline shift which measures approximately 7 
millimeters, unchanged from the preoperative study. The left lateral 
ventricle and primarily the occipital horn remains asymmetrically 
enlarged.  There are scattered foci of periventricular and 
subcortical FLAIR hyperintensities most compatible with microvascular 
ischemic disease.  
 
There is an approximately 3-4 millimeter enhancing lesion along the 
lateral aspect of the left temporal lobe (series 18, image 77), 
unchanged. There is a stable broad-based dural-based lesion along the 
right occipital lobe measuring 1.2 x 0.5 centimeters with homogeneous 
enhancement (sagittal image 116).   
 
There is no other area of restricted diffusion to suggest acute

Impression
Status post right frontoparietal and temporal craniotomy with 
associated postsurgical change and resection cavities within the 
right temporoparietal region and right anterior inferior temporal 
lobe as described. The resection margins demonstrate irregular T1 
hyperintensity pre and post contrast compatible with blood products 
and limiting evaluation for subtle enhancement. Persistent associated 
FLAIR hyperintensity compatible with edema and mass effect resulting 
in approximately 7 millimeters of leftward midline shift, unchanged. 
Stable asymmetric dilatation of the left lateral ventricle and 
occipital horn.  
 
Stable hemorrhagic and heterogeneously enhancing lesion within the 
right frontal lobe as described. Approximately 3-4 millimeter 
enhancing lesion along the lateral aspect of the LEFT temporal lobe, 
unchanged in size, as described. Stable broad-based dural-based 
lesion along the right occipital lobe measuring 1.2 x 0.5 centimeters 
with homogeneous enhancement (sagittal image 116) findings may 
represent a meningioma or dural-based metastasis.  Baseline exam.

hematoma in the overlying soft tissues.  
Redemonstrated is a complex multilobulated extra-axial collection 
with lentiform components subjacent to the craniotomy flap containing 
dependently layering hyperdense, acute blood products and fluid fluid 
levels, increased in thickness from the prior examination, measuring 
a maximum of 1.7 centimeters in thickness over the right temporal 
lobe. There are 2 major components, with the thinner ventral to the 
thicker right temporal component. Deep to this component of the 
extra-axial collection, there is a 1.6 x 1.4 hyperdense focus which 
appears to be located within the superior temporal lobe resection

Comparison
Prior study dated 12/25/2014. 
 
Findings
The patient is status post right-sided craniotomy. There is 
thickening of the dura underlying the calvarial defect. There is a 
mixed density extra-axial collection within the right temporal 
parietal regions measure approximately 9 mm at its maximum dimension.  
The collection appears more hypodense when compared to the prior 
study consistent with evolution.  The collection also appears 
slightly smaller.  There is some mass effect upon the underlying 
brain parenchyma with stable midline shift to the left. 
 
Again seen are areas of hypoattenuation / vasogenic edema involving 
the right temporal lobe which appears stable.   
Again seen is an area of vasogenic edema within the right temporal 
parietal region (image 21, series 2) which appears stable. The 
previously noted hyperdense lesion in this region appears less dense 
when compared to the prior study.  
There is enlarging area of vasogenic edema involving the left 
temporal lobe with a new hyperdense lesion within this region 
measuring 1.2 x 1.3 cm (image 19, series 2).  
There is a hyperdense lesion again noted within the right frontal 
lobe which appears slightly increased in size now measuring 
approximately 2 cm in its maximum dimension.  Again seen is 
surrounding vasogenic edema which appears increased with associated 
mass effect.  
There is an 8 mm hyperdense lesion within the left parietal lobe 
which appears slightly increased in size.  There is surrounding 
vasogenic edema with localized mass effect.  
 
There is no hydrocephalus.  There are multiple vascular 
calcifications.  There is small vessel disease.  There is no CT 
evidence of acute territorial infarct. The basal cisterns are patent.  
There is no acute calvarial fracture.  
 
There is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses 
and mastoids. 
 
Impression
1.  Evolving extra-axial collection on the right which appears less 
dense and slightly decreased in size. Stable mass effect with stable 
midline shift to the left.  
2. Enlarging lesions within the left temporal lobe, right frontal 
lobe, and left parietal lobe with new hyperdensity involving the 
lesion within the left temporal lobe which may represent interval 
hemorrhage into the lesion.  
3. Previously noted lesion within the right temporoparietal region 
appears less hyperdense.

Contrast
Contrast Agent GADAVIST 10 milliliters 01/06/2015 INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
Comparison
Prior study from December 9, 2014.  
 
Findings
The patient is status post right frontoparietal and temporal 
craniotomy.  There is a surgical cavity seen deep to the craniotomy 
site. There is increased T1 signal within the surgical cavity as well 
as the new right extra-axial collection superficial to the surgical 
bed measuring up to 1.2 cm in thickness.  
 
The inferior right surgical cavity in the temporal lobe also 
demonstrates hemorrhage.  There remains peripheral contrast 
enhancement around both the surgical sites which appears thicker and 
more nodular compared to the previous study. Evaluation for contrast 
enhancement is difficult due to large amount of blood products.  
 
The left temporal lesion has enlarged in size, now measuring 1.5 cm. 
The right frontal lesion measures approximately 1.5 cm in size with 
markedly increased edema and new foci of hemorrhage since the 
previous study. Additionally, there is a new high left parietal T1 
bright lesion measuring 3 mm (series 18 image 138) which may 
represent a small metastatic focus or hemorrhage.  
 
The right occipital dural based lesion appears unchanged.  
 
The pituitary gland is normal in size. 
Normal flow void is noted in the major arteries of the circle of 
Willis.  
There is no significant disease in the paranasal sinuses. 
The orbits are grossly unremarkable. 
 
Impression

     1. New high T1 signal within the surgical beds in the right 
frontoparietal and temporal regions, with a new extra-axial 
collection, most suggestive of hemorrhage, possibly due to friable 
vessels from radiation effects. Evaluation for recurrent tumor is 
very difficult due to the large amount of blood products.  However, 
there does appear to be increased nodular enhancement around the 
margins of the surgical bed. 
     2. Enlarging left temporal lesion, now measuring 1.5 cm. 
     3. Markedly increased edema around the right frontal lesion, 
which appears grossly unchanged in size but now demonstrates 
intralesional hemorrhage. 
     4. New high left parietal T1 hyperintense lesion, likely new 
hemorrhagic metastasis.

Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
There are multiple subcentimeter foci of abnormality on the B1000 
imaging within both frontal lobes, both parietal lobes, both 
occipital lobes, and the left cerebellum. Several of these have 
corresponding abnormality on the ADC imaging. Several of the lesions 
demonstrate some enhancement including 4 lesions within the right 
frontal lobe, a lesion within the left parietal lobe, and a lesion 
within the left occipital lobe. The remainder of the lesions do not 
demonstrate significant contrast enhancement. These lesions 
demonstrate corresponding FLAIR abnormality without significant 
surrounding vasogenic edema.  
 
There is no hydrocephalus.  There is no mass effect or midline shift. 
There is a subcentimeter focus of susceptibility on the gradient 
imaging in the region of the posterior aspect of the left lateral 
ventricle which may represent an area of old hemorrhagic products.  
There is no extra-axial collection. The pituitary gland is normal in 
size. 
Normal flow void is noted in the major arteries of the circle of

There is no significant disease in the paranasal sinuses. 
The orbits are grossly unremarkable. 
 
Impression
Multiple subcentimeter lesions as described above with only some 
demonstrating enhancement.  No significant vasogenic edema 
surrounding the lesions.  This raises the possibility of embolic 
infarcts of varying ages. Possibility of tumor emboli is also 
entertained but given the lack of significant vasogenic edema and 
enhancement of only several lesions embolic infarcts are favored.  
Correlate clinically.

MRI brain from 01/06/15 .  
 
Findings
Compared to the prior examination, there are 2 new subcentimeter foci 
of diffusion hyperintensity within the right occipital lobe (series 
400, image 10) without definite corresponding abnormality on ADC 
sequence or abnormal enhancement. The remaining foci of diffusion 
hyperintensity seen on the prior study have decreased in signal 
intensity.  
 
There are numerous small enhancing lesions within the cortex with 
many involving the gray-white junction, within the right precentral 
gyrus, 6 lesions within the right frontal lobe, multiple lesions 
within the right parieto-occipital region and single lesion within 
the left occipital lobe. These were seen and described on the prior 
study. There is very mild associated FLAIR signal abnormality without 
significant surrounding edema, mass effect or midline shift. There is 
no abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement. There are multiple additional 
small foci of FLAIR signal abnormality throughout the white matter, 
likely representing mild microvascular ischemic disease.  
 
There is no hydrocephalus.  There is no mass effect or midline shift. 
There is a subcentimeter focus of susceptibility on the gradient 
imaging in the left lateral periventricular white matter which likely 
represents remote microhemorrhage.  
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection.  
There is abnormal T1 hyperintensity involving the globi pallidi 
bilaterally.  
There is mild scattered mucosal thickening throughout the paranasal 
sinuses. The mastoid air cells are clear.  
The orbits are grossly unremarkable. 
 
Impression
New small foci of diffusion hyperintensity within the right occipital 
lobe without definite corresponding abnormality on the ADC sequence 
or enhancement, which may represent a subacute infarct.  
Numerous persistent small foci of enhancement centered at the 
corticomedullary junction with some demonstrating resolving diffusion 
hyperintensity, which may represent subacute embolic infarcts or 
tumor emboli.  
Signal abnormality involving the globus pallidus, which may be seen 
in hepatic failure and hyperalimentation / parenteral nutrition 
(manganese deposition) among other etiologies, correlate clinically.

Contrast
6.1 ml of gadavist was administered intravenously on 11/12/2015. 
 
Comparison
Prior MR imaging studies from 12/17/2014 and 12/12/2014 were 
reviewed. 
 
Findings
Patient is again noted to be status post left frontal craniotomy. 
Resection cavity in the left frontal lobe demonstrates small amounts 
of T1 hyperintense signal as well as rim enhancement. Degree of 
enhancement slightly increased from prior. Resection cavity is now 
filled with proteinaceous material.  
 
There is persistent T2/FLAIR hyperintense signal adjacent to the 
resection cavity both medially and anterosuperiorly with involvement 
of the cortex and effaces sulci in these regions. Spectroscopy 
preformed in superomedially demonstrates relatively increased NAA and 
increased lipid lactate alone with prominent elevation of choline 
compared to a similar region on the right. These findings raise 
concern that this signal abnormality represents residual tumor. There 
is decreased blood volume on perfusion imaging in this region which 
is of uncertain significance.  
 
There is no area of abnormally restricted diffusion to suggest acute 
infarction.  
 
The ventricles are normal. 
 
There is no midline shift or new focal parenchymal abnormality.

Clinical History
RULE-OUT PRIMARY CEREBRAL VASCULITIS/ANGIITIS 
  
 
History and Indication
AMS. Multiple small hemorrhagic foci on prior study.  
 
 
Technique
Multiple sequences were obtained through the brain without and with 
intravenous gadolinium. 
 
Contrast
 
 
Comparison
Non contrast MR study from 12/21/2014.  
 
Findings
There are innumerable hypointense foci involving bilateral cerebral 
hemispheres on susceptibility weighted images varying size  largest 
about 1.5 cm, but most of them  are very small  in size. Findings 
represent prior hemorrhages, mostly chronic with several subacute 
foci. There is no mass effect. There is mild amount of chronic small 
vessel disease in the cerebral white matter bilaterally.  
 
There is no area of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction.  

 
The ventricles are normal. 
There is no mass effect, midline shift.   
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. No 
abnormal contrast enhancement is noted in the brain or leptomeninges. 
There is a venous angioma in the left cerebellar hemisphere.  
The pituitary gland is normal in size. Again there is a pineal cyst 
measuring about 1 cm in maximum diameter.  
Normal flow void is noted in the major arteries of the circle of 
Willis.  
There is no significant disease in the paranasal sinuses. 
The orbits are grossly unremarkable. 
 
Impression
 Innumerable hypointense foci involving bilateral cerebral 
hemispheres on susceptibility weighted images varying size largest 
about 1.5 cm, but most of them are very small in size. Findings 
represent prior hemorrhages, mostly chronic with several subacute 
foci. Again findings may be from underline amyloid angiopathy or less 
likely uncontrolled hypertension.

 CT ANGIO HEAD WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST INCLUDING POST PROCESSING  
 
Clinical History
Altered mental status.  Seizures. Dementia.  
 
Technique
Noncontrast CT head: Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the 
skull base to the vertex without contrast. Coronal and sagittal 
reformations were obtained.  
 
CT angiography of the head: Following rapid uneventful intravenous 
administration of 110 milliliters of Omnipaque 350 contrast, after an 
appropriate delay, very thin helical axial slices were obtained 
through the entire head. Following this, 3-D workstation was employed 
to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent OMNIPAQUE 350 110 mg/dl 01/23/2015 INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
Comparison
No prior CTA head available for comparison. Correlation is made with 
the MRI brain and MRA head dated 01/21/2015. Correlation is also made 
with a non contrast head CT dated 01/20/2015.  
 
Findings
Noncontrast CT head: There is no significant interval change from the 
prior exam. There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or 
acute territorial infarction. There is confluent low attenuation in 
the deep and patchy low attenuation in the subcortical white matter, 
similar to the prior exam, representing the sequela of moderate small 
vessel ischemia.  Previously described nonspecific punctate 
hyperdense foci in the subcortical white matter of the frontal lobes 
are again noted, unchanged. There is no mass effect or midline shift.  
Stable size and configuration of the ventricular system, with no 
evidence of hydrocephalus. Incidental note is made of a cystic lesion 
in the pineal gland, measuring about 1.0 x 1.2 cm. This can be 
followed on MRI. The bony calvarium is grossly intact.  Visualized 
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  
 
CT angiography of the head:  
Anterior circulation: There is moderate calcification along the 
cavernous segments of both internal carotid arteries, with mild 
narrowing of the vessel lumen. There is no hemodynamically 
significant stenosis. The right A1 segment is hypoplastic. There is 
no beading or irregularity of the vessels to suggest vasculitis. 
There are bilateral hypoplastic PCOMs and there is a patent ACOM. 
 
Posterior circulation: The right vertebral artery is dominant. There 
is no hemodynamically significant stenosis there is no beading or 
irregularity of the vessels to suggest vasculitis. There are patent 
bilateral PICAs, hypoplastic right AICA and bilateral SCAs. 
 
No evidence of aneurysm or gross AVM in the circle of Willis.  
 
Impression
Noncontrast CT head: No significant interval change from 01/20/2015. 
No evidence of acute territorial infarction or acute intracranial 
hemorrhage. Moderate small vessel ischemic changes.  
1.0 x 1.2 cm cystic lesion in the pineal gland, most likely a pineal 
cyst. No hydrocephalus. However, given the size, continued followup 
with MRI is suggested. 
 
CT angiography of the head: No hemodynamically significant stenosis 
in the circle of Willis. No beading or irregularity of the vessels to 
suggest a vasculitis.

device terminating in the right frontal parenchyma.  
 
There are multiple foci of parenchymal hemorrhagic contusions in the 
bilateral inferior frontal lobes, left greater than right and left 
temporal pole.  There is mild associated adjacent hypodensity 
consistent with edema.  There is epidural hematoma in the right 
middle cranial fossa anteriorly along the greater wing of sphenoid 
with mild associated mass effect upon the adjacent temporal pole.  
There is interventricular hemorrhage in the left lateral ventricle. 
There are foci of pneumocephalus along the anterior/ inferior frontal 
convexities. There is punctate focus of hyperdensity in the midbrain 
along with punctate foci of hyperdensity at the gray-white matter 
junction in the frontal lobes, likely related to diffuse axonal 
injury.  
 
There is effacement of the suprasellar cistern consistent with 
posterocentral herniation.  There is a low position of the cerebellar 
tonsils through the foramen magnum consistent with downward 
herniation.  There is complete effacement of hemispheric sulci and 
sylvian fissures with effacement of the quadrigeminal plate cistern 
consistent with increased intracranial pressure. The ventricles are 
slit-like reach may also are being related to global increase in 
intracranial pressure.  
 
There are foci of hypodensity in the bilateral parietal and occipital 
lobes with loss of gray white matter differentiation, may represent 
infarcts versus edema.  
 
Evaluation of the soft tissues demonstrate extensive soft tissue 
swelling/ thickening with multiple foci of subcutaneous emphysema in 
the frontal scalp bilaterally and bilateral preorbital regions.  
Multiple foci of air are noted in the bilateral orbits.   
 
There are multiple comminuted fractures involving frontal bone 
traversing the outer and inner tables of the frontal sinuses and 
extending along the orbital roofs. There is also comminuted displaced 
fracture through the squamous part of the frontal bones bilaterally, 
right greater than left. There are multiple comminuted fractures of

CT angiogram of the head with contrast.  
 
Clinical History
Traumatic brain injury.  Intracranial hemorrhage.  
 
Technique
Contiguous axial CT images of the head were obtained following the 
rapid intravenous administration of 85 milliliters of Omnipaque 350 
contrast. Post processed 3D MIP reformations were obtained in the 
axial, coronal and sagittal planes.  Volume rendered 3D reformatted 
images were also obtained.  
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent OMNIPAQUE 350 85 milliliters 12/15/2014 INTRAVENOUS 
 
Comparison
No prior CTA of the head available for comparison.  
 
Findings
This examination is somewhat limited due to technical issues with a 
delayed phase of image acquisition. There is relative reason for 
paucity of the distal P4 branches within the left occipital lobe, 
which may be secondary to vasospasm or compression from edema. 
Otherwise, there is no occlusion or hemodynamically significant 
stenosis in the central arteries of the circle of Willis. Right 
vertebral artery is dominant. There is no gross aneurysm or 
arteriovenous malformation.  
 
Impression
No evidence of aneurysm or gross AVM in the circle of Willis.  
 
Relative paucity of distal P4 branches of the left PCA, within the 
occipital lobe, which may be secondary to vasospasm or compression 
from regional mass effect.

Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex without intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal 
reformatted images were obtained. 
 
Comparison
CT head without contrast on 12/14/2014 
 
Findings
Again noted is a right frontal approach intracranial pressure monitor 
device, terminating in the right frontal lobe. Streak artifact from 
this device somewhat limits evaluation of the parenchyma of the right 
frontal lobe. There is low attenuation in the mild subarachnoid 
hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe, in the region of the ICP 
monitoring device.  
 
There are multiple intraparenchymal hemorrhages in both frontal and 
both temporal lobes, left more than right, with surrounding edema, 
grossly similar to the prior exam. There is grossly unchanged 
hemorrhage layering in the left lateral ventricle.  
 
There are multiple patchy areas of low attenuation in the cerebellum, 
which are more apparent on today's exam and may reflect shearing 
injury.  
 
Multiple extensive confluent areas of low attenuation in bilateral 
high parietal lobes and bilateral occipital lobes, with loss of gray 
white matter differentiation (most notably in both occipital lobes) 
are also more apparent than the prior exam.  These represent edema 
and ischemic changes.  
 
Reidentified is a nonexpanding hyperdense, biconvex extra-axial 
collection along the convexity of the anterior right temporal lobe in 
the middle cranial fossa. There is unchanged mass effect on the 
underlying parenchyma in the right temporal lobe with low attenuation 
representing edema.  
 
There is stable thin subdural blood layering along the falx, towards 
the vertex.  
 
There is diffuse cerebral edema with extensive sulcal effacement. The 
ventricles are compressed with a slit like configuration, which is 
likely secondary to elevated intracranial pressure. There is no 
evidence of hydrocephalus.  
 
There is diffuse effacement of the suprasellar cistern, quadrigeminal 
plate cistern, CP angle and pre pontine cisterns, representing 
transtentorial herniation. There is persistence of downward 
herniation of the cerebellar tonsils.  
 
There is decreasing locules of pneumocephalus along the anterior 
frontal convexities.  
 
Extensive complex facial bone and skullbase fractures, involving the 
roofs of the orbits as well as the anterior and posterior walls of 
the frontal sinuses are again noted. Extraconal, retrobulbar or 
hematomas noted along the superior orbits. There is diffuse 
opacification of the paranasal sinuses. Please refer to the report of 
the dedicated facial bone CT dated 12/14/2014.  
 
There is extensive edema and hematoma overlying the entire calvarium 
which is increased from the prior exam.  
 
The left mastoid air cells are clear.  There is partial opacification 
of the air cells in the right mastoid tip.  
 
Endotracheal tube is noted on the scout images.  
 
Impression
Grossly stable multi compartmental hemorrhages with extensive 
cerebral edema and interval increased diffuse effacement of the basal 
cisterns, as described above, suggestive of transtentorial and 
tonsillar herniation.  
 
Multiple large patchy areas of low-attenuation within bilateral high 
parietal lobes and bilateral occipital lobes, with some loss of gray 
white matter differentiation, representing edema and/or ischemic 
changes.  
 
Extensive complex facial bone and skullbase fractures. Please refer

Findings
There is a right frontal approach intracranial pressure monitor 
device terminating in the right frontal lobe. There is interval 
placement of a left frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter 
terminating in the region of the posterior aspect of the left frontal 
horn. Small foci of air is noted along the catheter tract and within 
the frontal horns. The left ventricle is further decreased in size, 
with hemorrhage still noted within the occipital and temporal horns. 
Overall, the ventricles remain slit-like.  
 
There are multiple foci of hemorrhage most prominent within the 
bilateral frontotemporal regions, left greater than right. There is 
surrounding hypoattenuation reflecting edema and developing gliosis 
in this area. No new intraparenchymal hemorrhage is identified. 
Multiple areas of transcortical hypoattenuation are again noted 
within the frontoparietal region at the vertex likely reflecting 
evolving ischemia and/or contusion. Patchy areas of hypoattenuation 
within the cerebellum likely reflect sequela of shear injury. 
Redemonstrated are areas of biparieto-occipital hypoattenuation with 
mass effect and sulcal effacement, likely reflecting evolving 
infarction. There is hyperdensity in the right middle cranial fossa, 
which is less well appreciated than was seen on prior study, 
secondary to known epidural collection. There is subdural hemorrhage 
layering within the interhemispheric fissure and likely along the 
tentorial leaves bilaterally. There is a thin right convexity 
subdural hematoma, which is difficult to appreciate on the current 
study.  
 
There remains marked sulcal effacement and cerebral edema. There is 
mild rightward midline shift measuring approximately 3 millimeters. 
There is persistent diffuse effacement of the basal cisterns, 
including the suprasellar, quadrigeminal and ambient cisterns with 
evidence of transtentorial and uncal herniation. There is >10 
millimeters downward herniation of the cerebellar tonsils into the 
foramen magnum, appearing slightly more prominent than was seen on 
the prior study.  
 
Redemonstrated is marked subcutaneous swelling along the right 
parietal skull. Extensive calvarial and facial fractures are again 
noted. 
There is marked opacification of the paranasal sinuses. There is 
prominent opacification of the right mastoid air cells and middle ear 
cavity, minimally present on the left.  
 
Impression
Interval placement of a left frontal approach ventriculostomy 
catheter with associated postsurgical changes; interval decrease in 
left ventricular size with overall slit-like appearance of the 
ventricles. Diffuse, marked cerebral edema with effacement of the 
basal cisterns and findings compatible with tonsillar herniation 
which appears slightly more prominent than was seen on yesterday's 
study. There is slowly developing mild rightward midline shift.  
Multiple additional findings of traumatic and ischemic brain injury, 
as above.

Comparison
Head CT dated 12/19/2014.  
 
Findings
There has been interval removal of the right frontal approach ICP 
monitoring device.  
 
Redemonstrated is a left frontal approach ventricular shunt catheter 
with the catheter tip in the left lateral ventricle, terminating 
adjacent to the foramen of Monro. The ventricular system is stable in 
size and configuration since the prior exam. There is no evidence of 
developing hydrocephalus.

inferior frontal lobes and left temporal lobes, with persistent, but 
less apparent surrounding edema. Mild hemorrhage layering the 
occipital horn of the left lateral ventricle is noted.  
 
Again noted are evolving areas of infarction in the bilateral 
posterior parietal lobes and occipital lobes. 
 
There is unchanged effacement of the sulci and with partial 
effacement of the suprasellar cistern. Low-lying cerebellar tonsils 
are all unchanged, measuring 5 millimeters below the foramen magnum. 
Redemonstrated are patchy areas of low attenuation within bilateral 
cerebellar hemispheres.

Findings
There is a left parietal approach VP shunt catheter with its tip 
grossly unchanged in position located in the region of the left 
lateral ventricle. Given differences in technique, the ventricular 
system is decreased in size when compared to the prior study. There 
are stable areas of hypoattenuation involving both frontal lobes, 
both occipital lobes, both parietal lobes with associated mass 
effect. There is stable midline shift to the right which is minimal. 
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage.  
 
There is a new hypodense subdural collection within the left 
parietal-occipital regions measuring approximately 3 mm at its 
maximum dimension. There is minimal mass effect upon the underlying 
brain parenchyma. There are new subdural collections tracking along 
both tentorial leaves and within the posterior interhemispheric 
fissure.  
 
There is apparent hyperdensity of the entire venous system which may 
be secondary to the patient's underlying volume status.  
 
There is a focal area of encephalomalacia and gliosis within the left 
frontal lobe which is stable likely related to prior shunt tract.  
There is no CT evidence of acute territorial infarct. The basal 
cisterns remain small in caliber.  
 
There are grossly stable multiple facial bone fractures. There is 
partial opacification of the mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses.

Technique
Multidetector non contrast examination of the head. Coronal and 
sagittal reformations were obtained.  
CT perfusion: Before and during a contrast bolus injection, multiple 
5mm thick stacks of perfusion data were collected. Following this, 
workstation technology was employed to create time of arrival, blood 
flow, mean transit time and blood volume color perfusion maps. 
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
CT head:  
There is no CT evidence of acute transcortical infarction, 
intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. There is no mass 
effect or midline shift. The basal cisterns are patent. There is no 
tonsillar herniation. The  
Patchy foci of hypoattenuation within the periventricular and 
subcortical white matter without mass effect are most compatible with 
moderate microvascular ischemic changes given presence of 
atherosclerotic calcifications at the skullbase.  
 
There is advanced cerebral volume loss, particularly affecting the 
parietal and frontal lobes at the vertex although bilateral arachnoid 
pull cysts are also consented. 
The calvarium is intact.  
There is complete opacification of the right frontal sinus extending 
into the outflow tract and into the anterior ethmoid air cells. There 
is marked opacification of the right maxillary sinus with 
hyperostosis reflecting chronic obstructive disease. There is mild 
scattered mucosal thickening throughout the remainder of the 
paranasal sinuses.  There is fluid layering within the nasopharynx. 
The mastoid air cells are clear. The orbits appear unremarkable. 
There is a partially visualized sebaceous cyst in the subcutaneous 
soft tissues of the right cheek. 
 
CT perfusion:  
There is asymmetrical perfusion noted most prominently on the mean 
transit time and to a lesser degree cerebral blood flow maps, with 
apparent increased blood flow to the left cerebral hemisphere 
compared to the right.  
There is no definite asymmetry in the cerebral blood volume map to 
suggest an infarct core.  
 
Impression
No CT evidence of acute intracranial abnormality. Microvascular 
ischemic atherosclerotic calcific disease. Marked paranasal sinus 
mucosal disease.  
Asymmetrical perfusion that in the absence of CT evidence of acute 
transcortical infarction favors postictal hyperperfusion of the left 
cerebral hemisphere ; ischemia involving the contralateral hemisphere 
however is possible and should be excluded using diffusion-weighted 
MRI or alternatively, exclusion of a large vessel occlusion utilizing 
CTA.  
 
Findings discussed with Dr. Kaymakcalan of surgery via telephone.

Clinical History
SEIZURE. 
 
 
History and Indication
SEIZURE, S/P CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY 
 
 
Technique
A multi sequential, multiplanar MRI of the brain was performed 
without intravenous contrast.  
 
Comparison
Prior MRI brain available for comparison.  
 
Correlation is made with the non contrast head CT and CT perfusion, 
dated December 20, 2014. 
 
Findings
There is restricted diffusion in a predominantly gyriform pattern, 
within the high right frontal lobe and also right parietal lobe, 
towards the vertex. There is associated sulcal effacement in this 
region with corresponding hyperintense FLAIR signal. There are 
additional punctate areas of restricted diffusion with corresponding 
hyperintense FLAIR signal, scattered within the right occipital lobe, 
left frontal white matter and right temporal lobe white matter. There 
is less intense hyperintense B1000 signal within the right caudate 
head and right corona radiata, which may reflect slightly older 
restricted diffusion. 
 
There is extensive generalized loss of volume of the parenchyma with 
secondary prominence of the cortical sulci and ventricles. There is 
prominent extra-axial CSF signal along the convexity of the high 
right parietal lobe at the vertex come which may represent an 
arachnoid cyst.  
 
There is hyperintense FLAIR signal in the periventricular white 
matter and additional areas of punctate FLAIR signal scattered within 
the deep and subcortical white matter, representing the sequela of 
moderate chronic small vessel ischemia. There is a chronic lacunar 
infarct in the periventricular white matter adjacent to the left 
frontal horn.  
 
No evidence of hydrocephalus. There is no midline shift.  
 
There are few scattered punctate foci of susceptibility artifact in 
the right cerebral, brainstem, right temporal and right frontal 
lobes, representing hemosiderin from old micro hemorrhage, possibly 
hypertensive.  
 
The flow voids in the central arteries of the circle of Willis are 
present.  
 
The pituitary gland is flattened, which may be age appropriate.  
 
There is complete opacification of the right frontal sinus which 
demonstrate T1 isointense and mildly hypointense T2 signal with 
corresponding restricted diffusion. Moderate mucosal thickening is 
also noted of the anterior right ethmoid air cells and right 
maxillary sinus. 
 
There is an 1.6 x 0.9 cm well-defined nodule with low T1 and low T2 
signal in the subcutaneous fat overlying the right masticator muscle, 
which may represent a sebaceous cyst. Please correlate clinically 
with physical exam.  
 
Secretions are noted layering in the nasopharynx. There is partial 
opacification of the mastoid air cells, bilaterally.  
 
Impression

     1. Multiple areas of restricted diffusion, as described above, 
representing acute infarcts. Some of the gyriform restricted 
diffusion within the high right frontoparietal lobes may be 
attributed to the recent seizure, however, underlying ischemic 
changes in this region cannot be excluded. Additional multiple 
scattered infarcts are probably embolic. Please correlate clinically. 
Consider EEG.
     2. Right-sided paranasal sinus disease as described above, with 
restricted diffusion in the right frontal sinus which may be seen 
with acute pyogenic sinusitis. Please correlate clinically. 
These findings were discussed via telephone by Dr. Grechushkin of 
radiology with Dr. Svestka of surgery 10:57 am 12/23/2014.

CT of the head without contrast performed at an outside institution 
on 01/14/2015. 
 
Findings
There is no loss of gray-white matter distinction or other sign of

There has been interval placement of a right frontal approach 
subdural drainage catheter via a small craniotomy defect in the right 
frontal calvarium near the vertex. There is pneumocephalus within the 
right anterior cranial fossa adjacent to the craniotomy defect. There 
has been interval increase in the size of the right frontal subdural 
hematoma near the vertex which now measures approximately 1.93 cm in 
size, however, this increase in size appears to be related to the 
pneumocephalus the due to recent catheter placement.  There is mild 
interval increase in degree of mass effect upon the right frontal 
lobe near the vertex.  Again noted is a mixed density left frontal 
subdural hematoma measuring 7.5 mm in its greatest thickness exerting 
mild mass effect upon the left frontal lobe. Involutional changes are 
noted.  There is no focal parenchymal abnormality.  There is a old 
left frontal craniotomy defect near the vertex.  There is no evidence 
for fracture involving the calvarium.  The skullbase appears intact.  
There is no significant paranasal sinus disease.  
 
 
Impression
Interval placement of a right frontal approach subdural drainage 
catheter. Bifrontal subdural hematomas as described.  There has been 
a interval increase in size of a right frontal subdural hematoma, 
however, this appears to be related to the interval development of 
edema centrally due to recent subdural drainage catheter placement. 
There is resulting in mild interval increase in degree of mass effect 
upon the right frontal lobe.  Continued followup and clinical 
correlation is recommended.

Findings
Evaluation of hemorrhagic blood products is markedly limited 
secondary to limited sequences performed. Redemonstrated is a right 
frontal subdural drainage catheter, with heterogeneous T2 
hyperintense septated right frontoparietal subdural collection noted 
measuring a maximum of 1.5 centimeters in thickness, which is 
unchanged given differences in technique and modality. T2 hypointense 
components within the collection likely represents more acute 
hemorrhage seen on the prior CT. There are areas of pneumocephalus 
within the collection, all which grossly appears smaller compared to 
the prior examination. Also demonstrated is a left convexity T2 
hyperintense subdural collection measuring approximately 6-7 
millimeters in thickness. These collections exert mass effect present 
adjacent brain parenchyma without midline shift. Scattered foci of T2 
hyperintensity within the bihemispheric subcortical and 
periventricular white matter most consistent with microvascular 
ischemic disease. The basal cisterns are patent.  There is no 
hydrocephalus. There is no tonsillar herniation.  The visualized

Comparison
Prior MRI the brain from December 20, 2014.  
 
Findings
Postoperative changes of right posterior parietal craniotomy, with 
stable appearing dural thickening and enhancement subjacent to the 
craniotomy. The extensive vasogenic edema involving the right 
parietal lobe seen on the previous study is decreased in the interim 
as seen on T1 sequences however, lack of FLAIR or T2 sequences limits 
evaluation.  There remains some mildly nodular enhancement at the 
margins of the surgical bed. At the inferior aspect of the surgical 
bed, the enhancement appears more nodular compared to the previous 
study, with a 4 millimeter nodule noted (series 5 images 112-3). 
There has been slight interval contraction of the resection cavity.  
 
Again seen are 2 enhancing lesions in the right frontal lobe, the 
lesion on series 5 image 120 has slightly increased from the previous 
study, now measuring 5 mm compared to 3 mm on the previous study. The 
more superior subcortical lesion seen on series 5 image 146 now 
demonstrates rim enhancement, measuring approximately 9 mm 
significantly increased from 3 mm on the previous study. The 
surrounding vasogenic edema is likewise worsened. There is perhaps 
minimal enhancement previously seen in a left frontal lobe lesion.  
There is a questionable 2 millimeter punctate enhancing lesion within 
the left cerebellar hemisphere (series 5, image 48), incompletely 
evaluated without FLAIR images.  
 
There is no leptomeningeal enhancement.  There is no midline shift or 
herniation pattern.  
 
Impression

     1. Limited study for radiosurgery planning. 
     2. Enlargement of the 2 enhancing right frontal lesions with 
associated increasing vasogenic edema. 
     3. Interval increased nodular enhancement at the inferior aspect 
of the right posterior parietal surgical bed, worrisome for 
recurrence.
     4. Questionable new punctate enhancing lesion within the left 
cerebellar hemisphere, incompletely evaluated in the absence of FLAIR 
images.

Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the

Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
Evaluation for intracranial mass lesions is limited without 
intravenous contrast.  
 
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute 
territorial infarct. There is no focal extra-axial collections.  
There is no mass effect or midline shift.  There is generalized loss 
of volume of the brain parenchyma secondary prominence of the 
cortical sulci, cerebellar folia and ventricles. The degree of 
enlargement of the ventricular system is somewhat more than expected 
for the degree of volume loss.  There is also relative effacement of 
the sulci at the vertex. There is mild low attenuation in the 
periventricular white matter which may represent small vessel 
ischemia and/ or transependymal flow of CSF. Additionally, there is 
patchy low attenuation in the deep and subcortical white matter 
reflecting sequela of mild small vessel ischemia. There is an empty 
sella turcica. Vascular calcifications are present along the left 
vertebral artery and both internal carotid artery siphons.  
 
The bony calvarium is grossly intact. The visualized paranasal 
sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. There are nonspecific 
calcifications along the superior margin of the optic globes, right 
more than left. 
 
Impression
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute territorial 
infarct. No mass effect or midline shift.  
 
Mild enlargement of the ventricular system is normal somewhat than 
expected for the degree of volume loss, as described above.  Please 
correlate clinically to exclude normal pressure hydrocephalus.

Findings
There is no area of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction. 
There is a ring-enhancing lesion within the right frontal lobe best 
demonstrated image 115 on series 19 measuring 7.4 x 7.4 mm in size 
which given the patient's history of lung cancer is suspicious for a 
metastatic lesion. This lesion demonstrates some increased perfusion 
on the cerebral blood flow maps. There is no other enhancing 
abnormality. There is no evidence of a migrational disorder and the 
bilateral hippocampi by appear symmetrical and unremarkable in 
appearance. There is prominence of the sulci within the bowel 
cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres rated expected for the patient's 
age of 64 years suggesting some degree of cerebral and cerebellar 
atrophy.  Extensive white matter disease is noted within the 
bilateral cerebral hemispheres.  There are old lacunar infarctions 
involving both sides of the pons as well as within the left thalamus. 
There is no mass effect or midline shift and no definite evidence of 
intracranial hemorrhage. The susceptibility weighted images are 
degraded by motion artifact. The visualized portions of the sella, 
orbits, cavernous sinuses and internal auditory canals as well as the 
cerebellopontine angles appear unremarkable. The ventricles and 
cisterns appear unremarkable. There is no extra-axial collection.

Clinical History
Transient ischemic attack.  Evaluate for stroke.  
 
 
Technique
CT perfusion: Before and during a contrast bolus injection, multiple 
5mm thick stacks of perfusion data were collected   .Following this, 
workstation technology was employed to create time of arrival, blood 
flow, mean transit time and blood volume color perfusion maps. 
 
CT angio of the neck: Following rapid IV bolus of contrast material, 
rapid helical imaging with very thin slices from the aortic arch to 
the lower cranial level was performed. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was utilized to create 3-D rendered MIP images.  NASCET 
methodology was employed to evaluate the degree of stenosis. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Following rapid injection of intravenous 
contrast material after an appropriate delay, very thin helical axial 
slices were obtained through the entire head. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was employed to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent OMNIPAQUE 350 125 milliliters 12/28/2014 INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
 
Comparison
Non contrast head CT from same day.  
No images available for comparison.  
 
Findings
CT angio of the neck: Status post right endarterectomy with 
associated surgical vascular clips seen in the soft tissue. There is 
short segment high-grade stenosis of the proximal right internal 
carotid artery. The vessel is calculated to be 70 percent stenotic by 
computer vessel analysis, but visually appears at least 90 percent 
stenotic. There is an adaptive narrowing of the right internal 
carotid artery beyond this stenosis. There is no evidence of any 
stenosis or occlusion of the left carotid and bilateral vertebral 
arteries. 
 
CT angiography of the head: There is no evidence of aneurysm, AVM, or 
major artery occlusion. There is decreased density of contrast and 
decreased apparent caliber of right MCA branches which likely 
reflects the adaptive narrowing and the likelihood of contribution 
from collateral circulation.  
 
CT perfusion: There is increased mean transit time and decrease in 
blood flow in the distribution of the right middle cerebral artery, 
without definitive associated decrease in blood volume.  
 
Impression
CT angio of the neck: Status post right endarterectomy with short 
segment high-grade stenosis of the proximal right internal carotid. 
The vessel is 70 percent stenotic by computational methods but 
visually appears at least 90 percent stenotic. There is adopted 
narrowing of the right internal carotid artery distal to the 
stenosis.  
 
CT angiography of the head: No evidence of aneurysm, AVM, or arterial 
occlusion. Decrease contrast density and caliber of the sylvian 
branches of the right MCA.  
 
 
CT perfusion: Relative ischemia in the distribution of the right MCA 
territory without definitive infarct.

Findings
There are multiple foci of intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the 
bilateral cerebral hemispheres, centered within the bilateral 
temporal lobes, left greater than right, with a signal intensity on 
pre T1 sequences, suggesting subacute nature. The left temporal 
hemorrhage measures approximately 3.4 x 1.6 cm and the right temporal 
lobe hemorrhage measures approximately 3.3 x 1.7 cm. There is 
associated T2/FLAIR hyperintensity as well as restricted diffusion 
within portions of the bilateral temporal lobe hemorrhages. Multiple 
punctate to subcentimeter foci of hemorrhage adjacent to the 
posterior horns of the bilateral ventricles as well as within the 
cerebellum. 
 
On the postcontrast images, there is evidence of abnormal 
leptomeningeal enhancement.  No focal enhancing lesions are 
visualized.  
 
The ventricles are unremarkable in size and configuration. 
 
There is no mass effect. There is no evidence of midline shift or

There is a 0.6 x 0.6 x 1.1 cm enhancing lesion within the cervical 
spinal cord at the level of C1 /dens of C2. There is associated T2 / 
STIR hyperintensity which extends beyond the margin of the lesion to 
the level of the superior endplate of C3.  The spinal cord is normal 
in size.  
Multilevel degenerative disc disease is seen within the cervical 
spine.  
There is no large disc protrusion or critical central spinal 
stenosis.  
 
Impression

     1. Enhancing lesion corresponding to the previously seen 
T2/FLAIR hyperintensity adjacent to the left temporal horn measuring 
9 x 7 mm. 
     2. Abnormal enhancement within the cervical cord at the level of 
C1/dens of C2 measuring 6 x 6 x 11 mm with associated STIR 
hyperintensity extending to the superior endplate of C3. 
     3. These findings in conjunction with the previously seen foci 
of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity within the brain parenchyma is suggestive 
of benign disease such as multiple sclerosis.

Clinical History
Subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Patient found to have a 1-2 mm aneurysm 
involving the anterior communicating artery.  
 
 
Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were also performed.  
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
There is no loss of gray-white matter distinction or other sign of 
acute infarction. 
 
Again noted is evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage primarily within 
the pre pontine cistern as well as within the interpeduncular 
cistern, the right ambient cistern and the extending into the 
posterior aspect of the suprasellar cistern.  This is improved 
slightly in comparison to the previous study.  There is no other 
focus of intracranial hemorrhage. 
 
There is no mass effect, midline shift or  focal parenchymal 
abnormality.  
 
The calvarium and the skullbase appear intact.  
 
There is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses 
and mastoids. 
 
Impression
Slight interval improvement in degree of subarachnoid hemorrhage. The 
pattern of the subarachnoid hemorrhage is more typical for a 
perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage rather than hemorrhage 
associated with an anterior communicating artery aneurysm.

Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex without intravenous contrast. . Post processed coronal and 
sagittal reformats were subsequently obtained and reviewed. 
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
There is bifrontal subarachnoid hemorrhage. There is a midline 
hyperdense collection at the vertex, which crosses midline and 
extends ventrally, measuring up to 0.8 cm in maximum thickness with 
mild mass effect on the underlying parenchyma at the vertex. This 
collection is favored to be epidural.  There is also a subdural blood 
extending along the interhemispheric falx and minimally layering 
along the tentorium.  
 
There is no midline shift or hydrocephalus. There is no evidence of 
acute transcortical infarction. The basal cisterns are intact.  There 
is no tonsillar herniation.  
 
There is a nondisplaced fracture of the calvarium at the vertex, 
extending from the sagittal suture at the vertex throughout the 
coronal suture into the right frontal bone.  The fracture traverses 
the outer and inner tables of the right frontal sinus.  The right 
frontal sinus is opacified with hemorrhagic fluid.  There is partial 
opacification of the anterior right ethmoid and posterior left 
ethmoid air cell with hemorrhage. There is a large overlying scalp 
hematoma. Mastoid air cells are clear.  
 
The fracture may extend into the roof of the right orbit where there 
is suggestion of a small subperiosteal collection probably 
hemorrhagic.  The right optic globe is proptotic.

Comparison
CT head 01/04/2015, 01/03/2015 
 
Findings
There are punctate foci of susceptibility artifact within the right 
paramedian body of the corpus callosum (series 7, image 20) with 
associated FLAIR signal abnormality and slight mass effect, most 
compatible with sequelae of shear injury. There is an oblong 1.4 
centimeter long area of T1-T2 hyperintensity reflecting late subacute 
hemorrhage along the septum pellucidum more inferiorly (series 3, 
image 75), which was seen on the prior CTs. Minimal susceptibility 
artifact along the left tentorium may reflect minimal layering 
hemorrhage versus slight calcification.  
There is additionally a small focus of susceptibility artifact within 
the paramedian left parietal lobe, likely reflecting a small focus of 
remote micro hemorrhage. No intraventricular hemorrhage is 
identified. Right parietal scalp hematoma is again noted.   
 
There is no evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest acute 
infarction. There is no mass effect or midline shift.

Clinical History
Subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
 
Technique
CT angio of the neck: Following rapid IV bolus of contrast material, 
rapid helical imaging with very thin slices from the aortic arch to 
the lower cranial level was performed. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was utilized to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
NASCET methodology was employed to evaluate the degree of stenosis. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Following rapid injection of intravenous 
contrast material after an appropriate delay, very thin helical axial 
slices were obtained through the entire head. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was employed to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
 
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison.  
 
Findings
CT angio of the neck: There is no evidence of greater than 30% 
stenosis or occlusion of the right or left carotid and vertebral 
arteries. 
 
CT angiography of the head: There is aneurysmal dilatation involving 
the distal portion of the left posterior inferior cerebral artery 
which measures approximately 0.84 cm from the domes of the neck and 
approximately and 0.44 cm in width.  The neck measures approximately 
1 mm in thickness. There is also evidence of a arteriovenous 
malformation involving the right superior cerebellar hemispheres 
supplied by ostial branches from the right superior cerebellar artery 
and the branches of the right posterior cerebral artery. There is a 
needle aneurysm which appears multilobulated measuring 1.86 x 0.9 cm 
in size. The bilateral internal carotid, the bilateral anterior 
cerebral and bilateral middle cerebral arteries as well as the left 
superior cerebellar artery, the left posterior cerebral artery and 
the basilar artery appear unremarkable. Both posterior cerebral 
arteries appear unremarkable as well as the anterior communicating 
artery.

Clinical History
Left-sided weakness. History of prior CVA.  
 
Technique
CT perfusion: Before and during a contrast bolus injection, multiple 
5mm thick stacks of perfusion data were collected   .Following this, 
workstation technology was employed to create time of arrival, blood 
flow, mean transit time and blood volume color perfusion maps. 
 
CT angio of the neck: Following rapid IV bolus of contrast material, 
rapid helical imaging with very thin slices from the aortic arch to 
the lower cranial level was performed. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was utilized to create 3-D rendered MIP images.  NASCET 
methodology was employed to evaluate the degree of stenosis. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Following rapid injection of intravenous 
contrast material after an appropriate delay, very thin helical axial 
slices were obtained through the entire head. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was employed to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
 
Contrast
120 mL of Omnipaque 350 administered intravenously.  
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison.  
 
Findings
CT perfusion: Large perfusion deficit is seen within the right 
cerebral hemisphere in the right MCA and PCA territories, 
corresponding to the chronic infarct seen on the noncontrast CT head. 
 
CT angio of the head and neck:  There is complete occlusion of the 
right common carotid artery with occlusion of the right internal 
carotid artery with some reconstitution of flow within its 
supraclinoid portion via collateral circulation from the 
vertebrobasilar system and the left internal carotid artery system. 
There is diminished caliber to the right middle cerebral artery and 
the right anterior cerebral artery and its distal branches due to the 
right internal carotid artery occlusion. There is reconstitution of 
flow within the right external carotid artery via collateral 
circulation from the right deep cervical artery. The left common 
carotid, internal carotid and external carotid arteries appear 
unremarkable showing no evidence of a stenosis of 30 percent or 
greater. Bilateral vertebral arteries appear unremarkable.  There is 
no evidence  of an AVM or aneurysm.  
 
 
Impression
CT perfusion: Large perfusion defect within the right cerebral 
hemisphere corresponding to the chronic infarct seen on noncontrast 
CT head. 
 
CT angio of the neck: Complete occlusion of the right common carotid

Technique
CT perfusion: Before and during a contrast bolus injection, multiple 
5mm thick stacks of perfusion data were collected   .Following this, 
workstation technology was employed to create time of arrival, blood 
flow, mean transit time and blood volume color perfusion maps. 
 
CT angio of the neck: Following rapid IV bolus of contrast material, 
rapid helical imaging with very thin slices from the aortic arch to 
the lower cranial level was performed. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was utilized to create 3-D rendered MIP images.  NASCET 
methodology was employed to evaluate the degree of stenosis. 
 
CT angiography of the head: Following rapid injection of intravenous 
contrast material after an appropriate delay, very thin helical axial 
slices were obtained through the entire head. Following this, 3-D 
workstation was employed to create 3-D rendered and MIP images. 
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent OMNIPAQUE 350 135 milliliters 01/06/2015 
 
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison.  
 
Findings
CT perfusion: There is asymmetric decreased perfusion in the right 
parietal lobe on the blood flow and blood volume images with 
corresponding increase in MTT, likely secondary to upstream stenosis 
within the right internal carotid artery, as evidenced by a paucity 
of vasculature within this region on the CT angiogram images. 
 
CT angio of the neck: There is a patent right common carotid artery 
vascular stent extending into the proximal right internal carotid 
artery. The distal portion of the stent just beyond the bifurcation 
is somewhat narrowed causing 40-60 percent stenosis. The right 
external carotid artery is patent, and contrast opacified. There is 
no significant stenosis in the remainder of the right internal common 
carotid artery.  
 
The left common carotid artery also demonstrates extensive 
atherosclerotic plaque. There approximately 40-60 percent stenosis of 
the left internal carotid artery just distal to the bifurcation of 
the left common carotid artery.  
 
The origin of the vertebral arteries is difficult to visualize due to 
streak artifact from patient's shoulders.  However there is a 
suggestion of at least 40 percent stenosis. Secondary to calcified 
plaque at the origin of the right vertebral artery. There is 
otherwise significant stenosis of the vertebral arteries.  
 
CT angiography of the head: There is extensive atherosclerotic 
disease within the bilateral intracranial internal carotid arteries 
without stenosis greater than 30 percent.  The left MCA demonstrates 
irregular contour. There is a paucity of vessels within the right 
parietal lobe, likely secondary to upstream stenosis as described 
above. There is no aneurysm or AVM.  
 
Impression
CT perfusion: Asymmetric decreased perfusion within the right 
parietal lobe corresponding to the paucity of vessels seen on the CT 
angiogram of the head, likely chronic in the setting of upstream 
occlusion within the right internal carotid artery as described 
below. 
 
CT angio of the neck: Right carotid stent is patent but the distal 
portion is narrowed resulting in approximately 40-60 percent 
stenosis. Also 40-60 percent stenosis of the origin of the left ICA. 
Limited evaluation of vertebral origins, but suggestion of 40 percent 
or more stenosis of the origin of the right vertebral artery.  
 
CT angiography of the head: Paucity of vessels within the right 
parietal lobe, likely secondary to a history of stenosis within the 
right internal carotid artery. No significant stenosis within the 
remainder of the intracranial arteries. Extensive atherosclerotic 
disease within the bilateral intracranial internal carotid arteries 
and left MCA. No aneurysm or AVM.  
 
Please note that diffusion-weighted MRI imaging is a more sensitive 
modality for assessing for acute infarct in can be considered as 
clinically warranted.

CT HEAD ROUTINE WITHOUT CONTRAST  
 
Clinical History
Intracranial hemorrhage  
 
 
Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex. 
 
Comparison
Outside CT head from 01/07/15  
 
Findings
Redemonstrated is the left frontotemporoparietal convexity mixed 
attenuation subdural hematoma measuring approximately 7 millimeters 
in thickness, overall unchanged from the outside examination. The 
most prominent focus of acute hemorrhage which is intermixed with 
isodense components over the left posterior frontal lobe measures up 
to 7 millimeters in thickness (series 2, image 37), slightly more 
prominent than the prior study where it measured approximately 4 
millimeters. Minimal subdural hemorrhage layers along the left 
tentorium cerebelli. Redemonstrated is subarachnoid hemorrhage 
layering within the sulci of the left frontal convexity (series 2, 
image 31). The collection exerts mass effect on the subjacent brain 
parenchyma and rightward midline shift which measures approximately 4 
millimeters at the level of the bodies of the lateral ventricles. The 
basal cisterns are patent. There is no tonsillar herniation.  
 
Patchy foci of hypoattenuation within the periventricular and 
subcortical white matter without mass effect are most compatible with 
microvascular ischemic changes given presence of atherosclerotic 
calcifications at the skullbase. There are age indeterminate, likely 
chronic lacune infarcts within the right basal ganglia, most 
prominent on axial image 30. There is no CT evidence of acute 
transcortical infarction. There is mild age-related cerebral and 
cerebellar volume loss.  There is no hydrocephalus. There is 
prominence of the extra-axial spaces over the convexities.  
The calvarium is intact.  
 
There is no significant mucosal thickening within the paranasal 
sinuses.  The left mastoid air cells are clear.  There are scattered 
opacified mastoid air cells on the right.  
 
Impression
Acute on subacute to chronic mixed attenuation left 
frontotemporoparietal convexity subdural hematoma without significant 
interval change with the exception of slight increase in prominence 
of the focus of dependent acute hemorrhage within the collection, as 
above.  There is persistent mass-effect and rightward midline shift. 
Also redemonstrated is left frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  
Microvascular ischemic and atherosclerotic calcific disease.  Lacunar 
infarcts. Volume loss.

Comparison
CT head without contrast on 01/28/2015 at 11:06 a.m. 
 
Findings
There is interval placement of a right frontal approach ICP 
monitoring device terminate in the right frontal lobe. There are 
streak artifact from the pressure monitoring device limiting 
evaluation for subtle areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage. There is a 
small amount of extra-axial hemorrhage some which is likely 
subarachnoid within the right frontal region. There is a trace amount 
of pneumocephalus. There is some effacement of the gyri and sulci 
suggesting possible cerebral edema. The gray/ white matter 
differentiation appears slightly blurred involving both cerebral 
hemispheres.  
 
There is small vessel disease.  There is no hydrocephalus.  There are 
multiple vascular calcifications. There is slight hyperdensity 
involving the right M1 segment which is unchanged from the prior 
study and may represent vascular calcifications. The basal cisterns 
are patent.  There is no midline shift.  
 
The right frontal sinus is hypoplastic.  There is partial 
opacification of the bilateral maxillary sinuses, bilateral ethmoid 
and sphenoid sinuses. There are no sinus fracture is identified. 
There is extracranial soft tissue swelling with associated hematoma 
within both frontal scalp regions.  
 
Impression
Interval placement of a pressure monitoring device within the right 
frontal lobe with a small amount of extra-axial hemorrhage in this 
region.  
Some effacement of the gyri and sulci which may be secondary to 
edema. Grey-white matter differentiation appear slightly blurred 
which may be secondary to technique but anoxic injury is not entirely 
excluded. MR may be obtained for further evaluation.

Comparison
01/08/2015 
 
Findings
The study is limited due to metallic artifact causing streaking. 
 
There is increased brain swelling compared to the prior study.  The 
lateral and 3rd ventricles are considerably smaller.  There is 
effacement of all cerebral sulci. Evaluation of brain density is 
limited due to the artifact.  There does not appear to be diffuse 
abnormal hypodensity in the bilateral occipital lobes and posterior 
parietal lobes. Preservation of cortical density elsewhere cannot be 
reliably evaluated. 
Right frontal lobe pressure monitor is again noted.  
 
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection.  
 
 
There is prominent fluid and mucosal thickening in the bilateral 
maxillary sinuses with fluid also seen in the sphenoid and bilateral 
ethmoid sinuses and left frontal sinus. 
 
Impression
Decreased brain swelling.  Study is significantly limited by 
artifact.  Suggestion of diffuse abnormal hypodensity in the 
posterior aspects of the cerebral hemispheres.

63 YO FEMALE WITH HX OF COLORECTAL CA WITH METS TO LUNG AND LIVER, 
R/O BRAIN METS AS PT 
 
 
Technique
Multiple sequences were obtained through the brain without and with 
intravenous gadolinium. 
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent GADAVIST 4 milliliters 01/16/2015 INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
Comparison
Correlation is made to contrast-enhanced head CT from 01/13/2015  
 
Findings
There is no area of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction.  

Scattered nonspecific foci of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity within the 
bihemispheric subcortical and periventricular white matter seen, 
without mass effect, restricted diffusion or enhancement.  
There is mild age-related cerebral and cerebellar volume loss.  There 
is no hydrocephalus.  
There is no mass effect, midline shift or other focal parenchymal 
abnormality.   
An 8 millimeter T2 isointense extra-axial lesion is noted adjacent to 
superior superior sagittal sinus on the left posteriorly (series 18, 
image 125) common demonstrating no significant enhancement. 
Otherwise, there is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial 
collection. No abnormal contrast enhancement is noted in the brain or 
leptomeninges. There is a nonspecific 7 millimeter enhancing focus 
within the left paramedian frontal calvarium. There is a 
subcentimeter T1-T2 hyperintense focus within the right frontal 
calvarium, which likely represents a bone island.  
There is mild scattered mucosal thickening throughout the paranasal 
sinuses. The mastoid air cells are clear.  
The orbits are grossly unremarkable. 
 
Impression
No acute intracranial abnormality. No intracranial metastatic 
disease.  
Left posterior parasagittal subcentimeter lesion demonstrating no 
significant enhancement is nonspecific and may represent a small 
meningioma.  
Subcentimeter enhancing focus within the left paramedian frontal 
calvarium. Further evaluation may be obtained with bone scan to 
exclude metastatic disease.  
Scattered foci of signal abnormality throughout the bihemispheric 
white matter are most compatible with mild microvascular ischemic 
disease.

Findings
Again seen is a large heterogeneously lobulated enhancing solid mass 
in the left frontal lobe measuring approximately 5.3 x 4.0 
centimeters in maximal transverse by 6.5 centimeters AP diameter 
which contains areas of cystic degeneration/necrosis in the region of 
the superior frontal gyrus measuring approximately 2.3 x 0.7 x 1.7 
centimeter. The mass lesion involves both cortical and subcortical 
white matter with apparent invasion of the superior sagittal sinus 
anteriorly which is expanded and heterogeneously enhancing. There is 
extensive surrounding vasogenic edema.  There is associated mass 
effect on the subjacent brain parenchyma and compression of the left 
lateral ventricle. There is approximately 9 millimeters of rightward 
midline shift. The lesion is infiltrating and crossing the corpus 
callosum. There is additional enhancing soft tissue in the right 
anteromedial frontal lobe (superior frontal gyrus) measuring 
approximately 2.6 x 1.4 centimeters in transverse diameter with 
surrounding vasogenic edema and associated mass effect. The anterior 
communicating arteries are displaced rightward.  
 
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection.   
 
The calvarium is intact.  
 
 
Evaluation of the paranasal sinuses demonstrate mild mucosal 
thickening of the bilateral ethmoid and maxillary sinuses. There is 
evidence of bilateral cataract surgery. The orbits and orbital 
contents are otherwise unremarkable.  
 
 
Impression
Heterogeneously enhancing solid mass most compatible with a primary 
CNS neoplasm in the left frontal lobe, extending across the corpus 
callosum, and involving the right frontal lobe as described. There is 
extensive surrounding vasogenic edema and mass effect with 
approximately 9 millimeters of rightward midline shift. The mass is 
infiltrating / invading the superior sagittal sinus anteriorly which 
demonstrates heterogeneous attenuation post-contrast.  Recommend MRI 
for further evaluation as clinically appropriate.

Clinical History
Apnea at birth.  
 
 
History and Indication
Full term baby with apnea at birth.  
 
Technique
A multisequential, multiplanar MRI of the brain was performed without 
intravenous contrast.  
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Correlation is made with the neonatal head sonogram dated 01/15/2015.  

 
Findings
There is no restricted diffusion within the parenchyma to suggest an 
acute infarct.  
 
There is no mass, mass effect, midline shift or hydrocephalus.  
 
There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.  There is 
curvilinear susceptibility signal along the left tentorium, which 
demonstrates hyperintense signal on the phase source images, 
suggesting that this susceptibility signal is not related to 
hemorrhage, and may be related to a vessel.

No acute intracranial hemorrhage or compelling evidence for acute 
transcortical infarction. Areas of low attenuation in the 
periventricular and subcortical white matter, a nonspecific finding 
however most likely secondary to advanced chronic small vessel 
ischemic disease. Chronic lacunar infarctions in the basal ganglia 
bilaterally. Focal area of gliosis/ encephalomalacia in the left 
frontal periventricular white matter, likely reflecting chronic 
infarction. No extra-axial collection or midline shift. Involutional 
changes are noted. Ventriculomegaly noted, likely related to cortical 
volume loss. No acute depressed skull fracture. Diffuse sclerotic 
lesions in the skull, suggestive of metastatic disease. The native

1. Contiguous axial CT images of the head were obtained following the 
uneventful intravenous administration of 100 milliliters of Omnipaque 
300 contrast. Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were obtained.  
 
2. Contiguous axial CT images of the neck were obtained following the 
uneventful intravenous administration of 100 milliliters of Omnipaque 
300 contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were obtained.  
 
Contrast
100 cc of 300 mg / mL of Omnipaque was administered intravenously.  
 
 
Comparison
Non contrast CT of the head from the same day.  
 
Findings
CT scan of the head: There are no enhancing mass lesions within the 
parenchyma. Generalized age-related involutional changes are again 
noted.  There is no evidence of acute transcortical infarction. There 
is no mass effect or midline shift.  
 
Again redemonstrated is moderate enlargement of the lateral, 3rd, and 
4th ventricles, more than expected for the degree of volume loss. 
There is also bowing of the corpus callosum with relative effacement 
of the sulci at the vertex.  Constellation of findings may be seen 
with a communicating hydrocephalus (i.e. Normal pressure 
hydrocephalus). There is confluent low attenuation in the 
periventricular white matter, which may represent transependymal flow 
of CSF and /or chronic small vessel ischemia. In addition, there are 
patchy areas of low attenuation scattered within the deep and 
subcortical white matter and gangliocapsular regions, which could 
represent a sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemia.  Vascular 
calcifications are present in both intracranial internal carotid 
arteries, and intracranial vertebral arteries. There is a partially 
empty sella turcica.   
 
Diffusely heterogenous attenuation of the diploic space with multiple 
sclerotic lesions, most notably in the frontal calvarium.  
 
CT scan of the neck: Fat is maintained in the pterygopalatine fossa. 
No mass lesions in the masticator spaces. Evaluation of the oral 
cavity is obscured by streak artifact from dental hardware.  
 
There is fat stranding within heterogenous soft tissue attenuation 
overlying the left mandible with no discernible collection.  However, 
evaluation of this region is somewhat obscured by extensive streak 
artifact.  Please correlate clinically under physical exam for mass 
lesions and palpable collections. There is relatively symmetric hyper 
enhancement of the left submandibular gland, however, this may be 
reactive hyperemia given the adjacent inflammatory changes.  
 
The parotid glands are symmetric in size with no focal mass lesions. 
There also scored nonspecific sclerotic lesions in the right 
mandible. Review of nodal stations of the neck demonstrate no 
pathologically enlarged cervical lymph nodes by size criteria.  There 
are nonspecific subcentimeter level at 1, 2, level 3 lymph nodes, 
bilaterally.  
 
There is no focal mass in the pharynx or larynx. The thyroid gland is 
unremarkable.  There are no enhancing mass lesions in the carotid 
spaces. That is maintained in the parapharyngeal spaces. There is 
calcification of both carotid bulbs. There is a mild retropharyngeal 
course of the right common carotid artery at the level of C6-C7.  
 
There is cervical spondylosis with reversal of the curvature.  Trace 
anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 and C7 on T1 presumably degenerative.  
 
Impression

     1. Fat stranding and phlegmonous changes overlying the left 
mandible with no definite drainable collection.  However, portions of 
this region are obscured by streak artifact from dental hardware.  
Please correlate clinically for palpable collections and mass lesions 
in this region. 
     2. No enhancing intracranial mass lesions. 
     3. Heterogeneous attenuation of the calvarium with multiple 
sclerotic skull lesions and two sclerotic lesions in the right 
mandible. These are nonspecific, but may represent metastasis.  Other 
processes are not excluded.  Please correlate clinically, with 
patient's history. Nuclear medicine bone scintigraphy scan may be 
obtained to assess the full extent. 
     4. Redemonstrated is ventriculomegaly, which is likely ex vacuo 
and/or secondary to communicating hydrocephalus (i.e. NPH). Please 
correlate clinically.

Findings
There is no loss of gray-white matter distinction or other sign of 
acute infarction. 
Again noted are multiple hemorrhagic contusions involving bilateral 
anterior inferior frontal lobes, and inferior left temporal lobe, 
with persistent mild surrounding edema, similar to prior study. Small 
Acute subdural hemorrhages are again seen in middle cranial fossae 
bilaterally. Again noted are acute subdural hematomas  in the 
bilateral occipital parietal lobe region, which are slightly 
increased in density and size since the prior study. There is also a 
small subdural hemorrhage within the interhemispheric fissure also 
slightly increased in size. Mixed density subdural hemorrhage again 
seen in left temporal and frontal lobe region increase in size of the 
hypodense component about 6 mm in thickness previously  4 mm on 
coronal images. There is resultant mild increase in mass effect upon 
the adjacent parenchyma. There is also slightly increased midline 
shift to the right with mild subfalcine herniation to right. The 
midline shift is about 3-4 mm. Small subdural hygroma is again seen 
in the anterior superior aspect of the interhemispheric fissure on 
the right side of the falx cerebri. Again there is a small linear 
fracture of the occipital bone along on the right side of midline 
with mild comminution.  Again there is  small extra-axial hemorrhage 
adjacent to the fracture. There is also small subdural hemorrhages 
layering along the tentorium cerebelli bilaterally slightly increased 
from prior study. There is also small subarachnoid hemorrhage 
posteriorly to the right cerebellar hemisphere and also in the 
superior right parietal region. The foramen magnum is unremarkable. 
Linear non displaced fracture is also noted involving the right  
portion of the clivus. There is also subdural hematoma abutting 
clivus. Again there is probably small intraventricular hemorrhage. 
There is also a small subarachnoid hemorrhage in the interpeduncular 
cistern and medial aspect of the left temporal lobe.  There is also  
There is no change in the ventricular size.  No hydrocephalus. Again

History and Indication
Intracranial hemorrhage. Followup.  
 
 
Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex without intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal 
reconstructions were obtained. 
 
Comparison
Head CT dated 01/18/2015.  
 
Findings
Again noted are multiple hemorrhagic contusions within bilateral 
anterior inferior frontal lobes and inferior left temporal lobe with 
unchanged surrounding edema, similar to prior study. Again noted are 
similar-appearing subdural hematomas along the convexities of both 
parietal lobes at the vertex, not significantly changed in size from 
the prior exam. There is also a small subdural hemorrhage within the 
posterior interhemispheric fissure, unchanged. Mixed density subdural 
hemorrhage along the left frontotemporal convexity is slightly 
thicker than on the prior exam, measuring up to 7 millimeters 
(previously measured 6 millimeters in a similar level). There is 
unchanged mass effect on the underlying parenchyma. Mild bilateral 
subarachnoid hemorrhage in subarachnoid hemorrhage in the 
interpeduncular system are unchanged. Small amount of hemorrhage in 
the posterior fossa, on the right, is also similar to the prior exam. 
There is diffuse effacement of the cortical sulci, unchanged, 
indicating edema.  There is left-to-right midline shift measuring 4 
mm, unchanged. Subdural hemorrhage layering along the tentorium is 
unchanged.  
 
Again noted is a predominantly linear fracture of the right 
paramedian occipital bone, with mild comminution inferiorly. The 
fracture traverses the region of the right transverse sinus. If 
clinically warranted, followup MRV may to be obtained to assess 
patency of this sinus. Underlying extra-axial hemorrhage in the right 
posterior fossa is unchanged. Previously described skullbase 
fractures are similar to the prior exam.  There is no change in the 
ventricular size. There is no hydrocephalus. There is no evidence of 
acute transcortical infarct.  Again noted are partially opacified 
bilateral sphenoid and ethmoid sinuses.  
 
 
Impression
Allowing for differences in technique, no significant interval change 
from 01/18/2015. Multicompartmental hemorrhages with diffuse edema, 
mass effects and midline shift, unchanged from the prior exam. No 
change in the size of the ventricular system.  Please refer to the 
above report for details.

Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex. 
 
Comparison
No prior head CTs are available for comparison. 
 
Findings
Evaluation is limited due to image degradation related to patient 
motion, this is particularly pronounced at the skullbase and in the 
posterior fossa.  
 
There is no definite loss of gray-white matter distinction or other 
sign of acute transcortical infarction. 
Patchy foci of hypoattenuation within the periventricular and 
subcortical white matter without mass effect are most compatible with 
microvascular ischemic changes given presence of atherosclerotic 
calcifications at the skullbase. There are age-indeterminate lacunar 
infarcts involving the right external capsule, anterior limb of the 
right internal capsule on the right as well as the left external 
capsule.  
 
 
The ventricles, cisterns and sulci are age-appropriate in size. 
 
There is no mass effect or midline shift.  
 
There is no definite intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial 
collection. 
 
The calvarium is intact.  There is suggestion of mild soft tissue 
swelling at the vertex.  
 
There is no significant disease in the visualized paranasal sinuses 
and mastoids. 
 
 
Impression
No definite CT evidence of traumatic intracranial pathology within 
the limitations of this examination.  
Microvascular ischemic disease. Age-indeterminate lacunar infarcts.

POSSIBLE CVA 
 
 
Technique
Limited MRI examination of the brain was performed consisting of 
axial FLAIR and diffusion sequences  
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
 There is no evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest acute 
infarction.  
 
There are several scattered punctate foci of FLAIR signal abnormality 
within the bihemispheric subcortical and periventricular white matter 
(axial image 20) without associated mass effect or restricted 
diffusion.  
 
Ventricles, cisterns and sulci are age appropriate in size.  
 
There is no mass effect or midline shift. There is no intracranial 
hemorrhage or extra-axial collection.  
 
There are mucous retention cysts or polyps within both maxillary 
sinuses, with mild scattered mucosal thickening seen throughout the 
remainder of the paranasal sinuses.  
 
Impression 
No acute infarction.  
Several nonspecific scattered punctate foci of signal abnormality 
throughout the white matter may represent sequelae of vasospastic 
phenomena (migraines) and mild microvascular ischemic disease, among 
other etiologies.

Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex. 
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
There is no loss of gray-white matter distinction or other sign of 
acute infarction. 
 
There is a mass measuring 1.9 x 1.6 centimeters in the suprasellar 
region.  There is a high attenuation rim which likely represents 
calcification. And appears to be separate from the pituitary gland.  
 
The ventricles, cisterns and sulci are age-appropriate in size. There 
are periventricular low-attenuation white matter changes associated 
with chronic microvascular ischemic disease. There are multiple foci 
of low attenuation in the bilateral subinsular cortex region 
representing lacunar infarctions. The bilateral thalami  demonstrate 
small low attenuation foci from lacunar infarctions.  
 
There is no mass effect, or midline shift.  
 
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. 
 
The calvarium is intact.  
 
The partially visualized left maxillary sinus is completely 
opacified. The right maxillary sinus demonstrates circumferential 
mucoperiosteal thickening.  There are scattered bilateral ethmoid air 
cells that are opacified. The and frontal sinuses and bilateral 
sphenoid sinuses demonstrate circumferential mucoperiosteal 
thickening. The mastoid air cells are well aerated. 
 
Impression
No evidence of acute hemorrhage or infarction. Chronic microvascular 
ischemic change, mild global atrophy and multiple bilateral 
subinsular cortex and thalamic lacunar infarctions.  
 
1.9 x 1.6 centimeter suprasellar mass. Differential considerations 
include aneurysm, craniopharyngioma, and meningioma. Other possible 
differential considerations existing. Consider neurological 
consultation and additional imaging.

CT head without contrast 
 
Clinical History
CVA  
 
Technique
Multiple contiguous axial images were obtained from the skull base to 
the vertex without administration of intravenous contrast. Images 
were reviewed in soft tissue, subdural and bone windows. Post 
processing reformatted images were produced and reviewed. 
 
Comparison
None 
 
Findings
No acute intracranial hemorrhage. Focal area of hypodensity in the 
superolateral left frontal lobe, compatible with age indeterminate 
ischemia (series 2, image 31-39). No extra-axial collection or 
midline shift. Involutional changes are noted. No hydrocephalus. The 
bony calvarium is intact. The imaged portions of the orbits, 
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear unremarkable. 
Intracranial calcified arteriosclerotic vascular plaques are present.  

 
Impression
Focal area of hypodensity in superolateral left frontal lobe, 
compatible with age indeterminate ischemia; consider followup MRI for 
further evaluation if there is no contraindication.

There is no area of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction.  

There is a large complex developmental venous anomaly; much of the 
left hemisphere is drained by the internal cerebral vein which is 
very large. The left septal vein is also large. In the left 
hemisphere the tributaries to this large developmental anomalies have 
prominent perivascular spaces, which is best seen on axial FLAIR 
images (series 101, image 105). In left frontal lobe there is an 
associated small cavernoma which is best appreciated on the 
susceptibility images were there is dark signal. This cavernoma 
demonstrates a small focus of enhancement (series 14, image 133). 
There are 2 foci of white matter FLAIR hyperintensities elsewhere 
which are nonspecific.  
 
The ventricles are normal. 
There is no midline shift or other focal parenchymal abnormality. The 
bilateral mesial temporal lobes are unremarkable. There is no 
heterotopic gray matter.  
There is no extra-axial collection.

Findings
CT angio of the neck: There is a saccular aneurysm of the cavernous 
portion of the right internal carotid artery that arises just beyond 
the origin of the ipsilateral ophthalmic artery (series 3, image 186) 
measuring 0.6 x 0.8 cm in maximal axial dimensions and extending 
posteromedially to cause mild mass effect on the sella. The aneurysm 
appears completely contained within the sphenoid bone and does not 
extend intracranially. There is no evidence of greater than 30% 
stenosis or occlusion of the right or left carotid and vertebral 
arteries. 
 
CT angiography of the head: There is no evidence of aneurysm, AVM or 
vascular occlusive disease. There is persistent fetal contribution to 
the left posterior cerebral artery, with mild associated hypoplasia

History and Indication
HX OF EYE SWELLING 
 
 
Technique
Multiple sequences were obtained through the brain and orbits without 
and with intravenous gadolinium. 
 
Contrast
Contrast Agent GADAVIST 10 milliliters 01/22/2015 INTRAVENOUS 
 
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
 
There is minimal increase in fluid within the bilateral optic nerve 
sheaths. There is no significant optic nerve tortuosity appreciated. 
There is a suggestion of possible minimal flattening of the posterior 
sclera bilaterally.  
 
There is mild patchy bilateral optic nerve enhancement. No other 
abnormal contrast enhancing structure or masses are noted in the 
orbits.  
 
There is a single very small subcentimeter FLAIR hyperintensity in 
the left frontal lobe white matter. This lesion is not juxtacortical 
or periventricular, and is nonspecific in etiology.  
 
The globes, extraocular muscles, visible vascular structures and 
orbital fat are otherwise unremarkable in both orbits.  
 
 
The optic chiasm is normal in appearance. There is no suprasellar or 
parasellar mass. There is a partially empty sella turcica. The 
pituitary is otherwise unremarkable.  
 
The ventricles are normal. 
There is no mass effect or  midline shift.   
 
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. No 
abnormal contrast enhancement is noted in the brain or leptomeninges. 
Normal flow void is noted in the major arteries of the circle of 
Willis. There is no significant disease in the paranasal sinuses. 
 
 
Impression
 
Mild bilateral patchy optic nerve enhancement which raises concern 
for mild or early optic neuritis. There is a single nonspecific white 
matter FLAIR hyperintensity. Correlate clinically for optic neuritis 
and possible early demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis 
or neuromyelitis optica.     
 
Suggestion of mild flattening of the posterior sclera and there is a 
partially empty sella. Given these findings in the setting of 
reported clinical history of papilledema on ophthalmic exam, this 
raises concern for intracranial hypertension, either idiopathic or 
secondary.

were reviewed in soft tissue, subdural and bone windows. Post 
processing reformatted images were produced and reviewed. 
 
Comparison
None 
 
Findings
Postsurgical changes related to left temporo-frontoparietal 
craniotomy/cranioplasty. Nonspecific extra-axial iso- to hyperdense 
areas subjacent to surgical site, notably in left frontal and 
parietal regions, may be related to surgical material, reflect areas 
of dural thickening and/or subdural hemorrhage. In addition, there 
are nonspecific curvilinear areas of hyperdensity in the left frontal 
lobe inferolaterally (series 2, images 15-23), which may also reflect 
hemorrhage. Extensive areas of gliosis/encephalomalacia in the left 
temporal, frontal and parietal lobes. There is ex vacuo dilatation of 
the left lateral ventricle due to hemispheric volume loss. Linear 
area of hypodensity in the right frontal lobe extending to the 
frontal horn of the right lateral ventricle, likely reflects sequela 
of prior catheter placement. No midline shift. The imaged portions of

Findings
Postsurgical changes related to left temporo-frontoparietal 
craniotomy/cranioplasty. Nonspecific extra-axial iso- to hyperdense 
areas subjacent to surgical site, notably in left frontal and 
parietal regions, without change from prior study suggesting post

excluded. 
 
Persistent nonspecific curvilinear areas of hyperdensity in the left 
frontal lobe inferolaterally (series 2, images 24-30), which may 
reflect hemorrhage versus calcification.  
 
Extensive areas of gliosis/encephalomalacia in the left temporal,

     1. Postsurgical changes related to left temporo-frontoparietal 
craniotomy/cranioplasty. Nonspecific extra-axial iso- to hyperdense 
areas at surgical site, notably in frontal and parietal regions. This 
is unchanged from recent prior and likely represents post-surgical 
dural thickening with calcification. The possibility that this 
represents a small subdural hemorrhage cannot be entirely excluded.

MULTIPLE TRAUMA VICTIM 
 
 
Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex. 
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
There is no CT evidence of acute cortical infarction, intracranial 
hemorrhage or extra-axial collection.  There is no mass effect or 
midline shift.  
 
There are numerous chronic appearing lacunar infarcts. Among these is 
a 0.6 cm hyperdensity in the posterior limb of the left internal 
capsule (series 2, image 30), most consistent with chronic lacunar 
infarct. There is a hypodensity seen within the anterior aspect of 
the right external capsule (series 2, image 29), also favored to 
represent chronic lacunar infarct.  
Confluent areas of hypoattenuation within the periventricular and 
subcortical white matter without mass effect are most compatible with 
advanced microvascular ischemic changes given presence of 
atherosclerotic calcifications at the skullbase.  
 
There is moderate to advanced through ball and cerebellar volume loss 
is ex vacuo ventricular prominence.  
There is mild hyperdensity of the intracranial vasculature, which may 
represent hemoconcentration.  
 
The calvarium is intact. There is mucosal thickening within the left 
sphenoid and right maxillary sinuses. The paranasal sinuses and 
mastoids are otherwise clear bilaterally. Visualized orbits appear 
unremarkable.  
 
Impression

     1. No CT evidence of acute traumatic intracranial pathology. 
     2. Advanced microvascular ischemic and atherosclerotic calcific 
disease.  Multiple chronic appearing lacunar infarcts.

Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex. Coronal and sagittal reformats were also performed and 
interpreted. 
 
 
Comparison
No prior study available for comparison. 
 
 
Findings
There is no loss of gray-white matter distinction or other sign of 
acute infarction. There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial 
collection.  
 
There is moderate dilatation of the ventricles and sulci which 
represent involutional changes. There is moderate severe hypodensity 
within the subcortical and deep white matter consistent with moderate 
small vessel disease. The ventricles are dilated out of proportion to 
the sulci likely related to central atrophy.There is no evidence of 
hydrocephalus. There is no mass effect, midline shift or focal 
parenchymal abnormality.  
 
The calvarium is intact. No significant disease is noted in the 
paranasal sinuses or mastoids.  
 
 
Impression
No acute intracranial pathology. 
Evidence of central atrophy and involutional changes as well as

Clinical History
 NEW ONSET SEIZURE 
 
 
History and Indication
New onset seizures.  
 
 
Technique
A multisequential, multiplanar MRI of the brain was performed without 
intravenous contrast.  
 
Comparison
No prior MRI brain available for comparison.  
 
Correlation is made with head CT performed earlier the same day.  
 
Findings
There is no restricted diffusion of the brain parenchyma to suggest 
an acute infarction. There is no mass effect, midline shift or 
hydrocephalus. Ventricles, cisterns and sulci are age appropriate in 
size. There is a single punctate focus of hyperintense T2/FLAIR 
signal along the right external capsule. This is nonspecific and has 
been described in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, and may 
be clinically insignificant.  
 
The brain parenchyma demonstrates a normal pattern of gyration and 
myelination, with no evidence of migrational abnormality.  The 
hippocampal formations are normal and symmetric in size and signal.  
Fornices and temporal horns are symmetric.  
 
The flow voids of the central arteries of the circle of Willis are 
present. There is no tonsillar herniation  
 
The visualized intraorbital contents are unremarkable.  
 
There are no fluid levels in the visualized paranasal sinuses or 
mastoid air cells.  Nasal septum is deviated to the right.  There is 
a left concha bullosa.  There is mild mucosal thickening in the 
anterior ethmoids, bilaterally.  
 
Impression
No evidence of acute infarction or mesial temporal sclerosis. No mass 
effect, midline shift or hydrocephalus.

Comparison
No prior MRI brain available for comparison.  
 
Correlation is made with a head CT performed earlier the same day.  
 
Findings
There is no evidence of restricted diffusion in the brain parenchyma 
to suggesting acute infarction.  
 
There is curvilinear signal void on the susceptibility weighted 
images, which may represent a developmental venous anomaly.  
 
Brain parenchyma demonstrates a normal pattern of gyration and 
myelination. 
 
There are a few punctate foci of T2/FLAIR signal, scattered within 
the deep and subcortical white matter, predominantly in the left 
frontal lobe.  These are nonspecific and have been described in of 
symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.  
 
There is no mass effect, midline shift or hydrocephalus.  
 
There is no focal extra-axial collections.  
 
Right vertebral artery is hypoplastic. Flow voids of the central 
arteries of the circle of Willis are present. There is no flow void 
in the right transverse sinus, sigmoid sinus or visualized high right 
internal jugular vein.  This however may be secondary to slow flow.  
 
The hippocampal format shins are normal and symmetric in size and 
signal. The temporal horns are symmetric. The fornices are symmetric.  

 
There is no tonsillar herniation. The sella turcica is unremarkable.  
 
The cisternal segments of cranial nerves 3, 5, 7 and 8 are normal and 
symmetric in size and signal.  There is normal T2 signal in the 
cochlear, semicircular canals and vestibule. No definite 
cerebellopontine angle mass, however, evaluation is limited without 
intravenous contrast.  
 
There is mucosal thickening in the right frontal sinus.  There is 
mucosal thickening and partial opacification of the anterior ethmoid 
air cells, bilaterally. Mucosal thickening is also present in the 
posterior ethmoid air cells and left sphenoid sinus. There is partial 
opacification of the mastoid air cells, bilaterally.  
 
 
Impression
1. No evidence of acute infarct, migrational abnormality or mesial 
temporal sclerosis. No mass effect, midline shift or hydrocephalus.  
 
2. Absent flow voids in the right transverse sinus, sigmoid sinus and

Clinical History
EVALUATE FOR TRAUMATIC INJURY 
 
 
History and Indication
S/P TRAUMA 
 
 
Technique
Contiguous axial slices were obtained from the skull base to the 
vertex. 
 
Comparison
No images available for comparison. 
 
Findings
There is no loss of gray-white matter distinction or other sign of 
acute infarction. 
 
Advanced involutional changes are consistent with patient's age.  
 
There is no mass effect or midline shift. Scattered periventricular 
and deep cortical white matter hypodensities are nonspecific but 
favored to represent chronic microvascular ischemic changes.  
 
There is no intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. 
 
The calvarium is intact. There are small mucous retention cysts 
within the bilateral maxillary sinuses. The visualized paranasal 
sinuses and mastoids are otherwise clear bilaterally. There is stapes 
prosthesis within the right middle ear near the oval window.  There 
is a 0.2 cm calcification in the left parotid gland (series 2, image 
7) favored to represent represent a small sialolith. There is a soft 
tissue density within the left external auditory canal likely 
representing cerumen.  
 
Impression

     1. No acute traumatic intracranial pathology. Involutional 
changes and chronic microvascular ischemic changes. 
     2. Stapes prosthesis within the right middle ear as described 
above. 
     3. Small-cell left within the left parotid gland. 
     4. Soft tissue density within the left external auditory canal 
likely representing cerumen.
