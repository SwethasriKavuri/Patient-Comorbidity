Technique Gray scale ultrasound and color Doppler were utilized to evaluate the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Comparison There are no prior studies available for direct comparison. Findings The upper abdominal aorta and IVC are grossly unremarkable. The liver is not enlarged at 15.1 cm in length. It is normal in echogenicity. There are no focal liver masses. There is no intrahepatic ductal dilatation. No evidence of cholelithiasis or sludge within the gallbladder. There is no evidence of gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid. Sonographic Murphy sign was negative. There is a tiny non mobile echogenic focus along the gallbladder wall measuring up to 3.2 mm, compatible with a tiny polyp. There is no extrahepatic ductal dilatation. The common bile duct is seen, maximum caliber 6.6 mm. The distal duct is obscured. The visualized pancreas is unremarkable. The tail and contiguous body are obscured by bowel gas. . The right kidney is 10.6 cm in length. There is no evidence of right hydronephrosis. There are no visualized shadowing right renal calculi. The right renal parenchyma is normal in echogenicity. There is no right upper quadrant ascites. Impression No evidence of cholelithiasis. No sonographic evidence to suggest acute cholecystitis. Mild /borderline nonspecific prominence of the common bile duct measuring up to 6.6 mm in caliber. Correlate with biliary function tests. Tiny gallbladder polyp which can be followed in 1 year. .

Good quality study. 2. Coronary artery calcium score by Agatston's criteria is97, representing 99th percentile by age, gender and ethnicity based on the MESA criteria. 3. On the coronary CTA portion of the study, there is evidence of nonobstructive CAD by CT criteria. 4. Aortic size is normal in the visualized portions; in the visualized portions, there is no evidence of thoracic aortic dissection. Recommendation Follow up with PCP for aggressive coronary artery disease risk factor modifications. Clinical Information Epigastric pain.
