No prior CTscan of the chest is available for comparison. A prior CT of theabdomen which includes the inferior thorax is available from June 9,2005.Findings:A relatively large right pleural effusion is present. Attenuation ofthe fluid is close to water suggesting this is a transudate but itshould be noted that there is overlap between exudate and transudateon CT. The right pleural effusion was not present on the prior study.There is some adjacent peripheral compression atelectasis. Centralbronchial anatomy appears to be patent suggesting that there is nocentrally obstructing mass. A much smaller nonspecific left pleuraleffusion is seen with some minimal adjacent atelectasis. No thoracicadenopathy is identified. Heart size is not enlarged. There is nosignificant pericardial effusion.A 1.5 cm focus of decreased attenuation is seen in the superior,lateral right lobe of the liver (image 50) which is likely incidentalas this finding was present on the prior CT study and is withoutinterval change. The patient is apparently status post partialresection of right kidney. The gallbladder is dilated measuringapproximately 6 cm in cross-sectional diameter. No wall thickening isappreciated. Attenuation of the bile is increased which may representdelayed excretion of\npreviously administered intravenous contrast.\nIMPRESSION:1. Large right pleural effusion of indeterminate etiology.Thoracentesis advised.2. Small lesion in liver as described above, stable since June, 2005,likely representing hemangioma or other incidental abnormality.3.
